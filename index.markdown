# Chapter 1: More Than This #

"Where is Avalon? I want to see Avalon!" the princess shouted, running in her morning dress to her bedroom door. She slammed herself against it, surprised for a moment by how sturdy and unforgiving it was, unbending even to the wishes of its princess.

"Princess, please. Please I beg you..."

The princess turned, leaving the little hurt caused by the door behind. She pivoted into her frustration and anger, turning to the chambermaid. She raised a delicate arm with its pointed finger straight at the unassuming young woman, "You! You're the cause of this."

The chambermaid, clutching the princess' daytime undergarments, trying desperately to get her dressed so she could move on to her other morning chores, took a step back, took several in fact, catching her foot on the base of the clawed dressing table. "No, I promise you. This isn't me. I delivered the house mistress your request. I swear."

Now circling around a worn spot in the layered carpets in her chambers, the princess fumed, "No you didn't. You're a sneaking and conniving thing." She paused, "And you're not good at your job. I know. I saw when you attended Avalon. I saw your little mistakes then, and I see them now. There's nothing left to do but..." The princess made for a lattice-work grill at the end of a pipe extending from the wall.

The chambermaid dashed towards the princess, seized her arm without realizing what she was doing, "Please no..."

The princess tore away from the chambermaid's grasp. "How dare you! You could be executed for doing that!"

The chambermaid went rigid, straightened herself up, but bowed her head low. "Please forgive me, princess. It's just that..."

"Just what?" The chambermaid was silent. "Go on. Explain yourself."

"If I'm reassigned one more time, I may be expelled from the house. And then my mother. My poor dear mother. What will we do?"

The chambermaid was on the verge of crying. The princess could see that, could see the young woman's shoulders quivering under her dark servant's dress. The princess turned away from her maid, folded her arms tightly across her body. She closed her eyes and took a breath. Just as Avalon had taught her. Avalon was the only person who could lift her from these angers she had, the sads, and other unwanted feelings.

She wanted to see Avalon, because then everything would feel right and better. She would be who she really was and who she really wanted to be, the beloved princess, the treasure, the token. But she couldn't see Avalon and now she made her maid cry. What would Avalon say?

The princess turned back to the maid. "Fine. Say you're sorry and I will forget your indiscretion. "

The chambermaid curtsied and said in a hushed voice, "I'm truly sorry princess. You are merciful and..."

"You don't need to make a show out of it. Stop that and get me dressed."

"Yes your highness."

"And I want to know the moment that Avalon is available to be seen. Do you understand?"

"Of course. As soon as we're done I will tell the house mistress."

"Good, then we have an understanding. Please proceed with my morning."

As the maid dressed her, the princess wished she had not scolded her the way she had. Normally her new maid was efficient, but chatty at same time. The princess enjoyed hearing about the gossip among the servants, even if she pretended otherwise.

Now the maid's efficiency felt forced, and her silence deliberate. But the princess let her finish her morning preparations and curstsey her way out of the princess's room.

As she normally did, the princess remained at her dressing table brushing out her long dark hair, until she was called down for breakfast. Normally one of the second or third tier maids would lightly knock on her door and whisper, "My lord and lady are ready for you, your highness."

The princess nearly dropped her brush when, instead of a light tap, there was a sharp rap on the door and it opened. The house mistress came into her room. She stopped, though, once inside the room, as was the custom and waited for the princess to acknowledge her.

The princess brushed her hair several more times, before turning in her chair to acknowledge that the house mistress, one of her mother's favorite servants, had entered her chambers.

The house mistress tilted her neck just enough to avoid breaching protocol, but didn't hide the brusque tension in the gesture.

Finally impatient with the little game they were playing, the princess said curtly, "Yes, what is it? Breakfast time again?"

"Yes your highness, but not just that. Your maid told me..."

"I knew she would go squealing to you..."

"I assure you there was no squealing involved. I simply wanted to inform you that I received your message about Avalon."

"Fine, then I expect to see her as soon as it is possible."

"Convenient, your highness."

"Convenient? Convenient for who?"

"Convenient for the priests and for Avalon."

"Priests!? What do they have to do with anything? I only ask for patience."

"Princess, as you well know, they have to do with many things."

The princess scrutinized the house mistress closely, looking her up and down. The woman seemed more imperious than usual. What was the reason?

The princess stood and swept her way in her fine dress to the windows overlooking a cultivated garden outside the great house where she lived. "I don't understand all of this talk about convenience and patience."

She could hear the wizened woman let out a barely detected sigh, "Yes, your highness, but I have orders that you are not to disturb Avalon until it is convenient, for her, as well as the priests."

"And these orders came from?"

"From my lady, your highness."

The princess fumed, tightening her fingers into white knuckled knots, "Well that figures. There is only one solution for this, and that solution lies beyond one. I will take my leave for breakfast now."

"As you wish, your highness." The house mistress retreated from her room, leaving the princess alone in her room with her anger and frustration.

She stood at the window for several minutes, watching the gardeners pushing carts along the grounds, trimming hedges, picking weeds, and doing the hundreds of tasks that the King's, her father's house required, to maintain its stature as the finest and grandest house in the land.

***

Her mother and father sat at a long table in the great hall eating breakfast. Servants stood stiffly in the wings, waiting to attend to the King and Queen's needs.

Her father looked up and nodded at her in acknowledgement then returned to reading from a despatch box of papers spread out around him. Her mother wiped her mouth carefully and motioned her to an empty seat.

"Sit darling and eat your breakfast."

She plodded into the room and plopped into the chair, wanting her dissatisfaction to register plainly. But the plodding and plopping barely registered with her father.

Her mother arched and eyebrow and gave her father a meaningful look, but the King ignored her, preferring to grunt over whatever it was he reading at the moment.

The princess ignored her mother's meaningful look and made room for the servants to place her breakfast before her. She knew that if she could engage her father, she could get the barriers keeping her from visiting Avalon to go away.

"Father, must you read at the table."

"Your father is busy right now and those papers must be returned. Now dear, let's talk about our day."

"Our day? What day?"

"Why this day, of course. Today. Why, what other day would I be referring to?"

"How am I to know? Why does today deserve a day? That's my question."

Her father peered up from his papers and said gruffly, "The priests are due to arrive today, you know that," and went back to her reading.

The princess could see a look of exasperation pass across her mother's face, as if some agreed upon stratagem between her mother and father had broken down. If her mother had been the type, she imagined that she would have kicked the King under the table.

Instead, she composed her self, took another sip of coffee. When her cup clinked back down, she looked at the princess again, as if ready for another volley, "Yes, as your father said, the priests are due to arrive. And, darling, it causes such a disturbance. I thought it would be pleasant to plan an outing. I already have the warden making preparations. I thought we could observe the deer in the eastern forest. The warden told me that there a new season of fawns have been born. What do you say?"

The princess eyed her parents and decided to charge ahead, full frontal, with her demand, rather than retreat behind the pleasant plans that her mother was trying to distract her with. "I want to see Avalon. She's been gone for weeks now and I want to see her."

"Out of the question," her father replied, in the voice he reserved for ministers and commanders, and sometimes his daughter.

"But father..."

"Dear, what your father means..."

Her father, the King, put down his papers and replied, "What your father means is no. You are forbidden to see Avalon until you are told otherwise. Do you understand?" The princess slumped in her chair. "Do you understand?"

"Yes, father."

Her father's eyes brightened and he smiled at her mother, he bushy mustache crinkling around his mouth, "Good, then we have an understanding. No more talk of Avalon until otherwise noted."

Her mother, following her father's example, smiled as well. "Good. Then about that outing..."

***

The east woods were at the very edge of the King's personal estate. Surely her mother had chosen that location on purpose. They would spend most of the day just traveling there and back.

The princess was not in the mood to ride horses, much to her mother's disappointment. Her mother had met her out near the stables in her riding attire, seemingly bounding with energy. The princess had changed into traveling attire, but nothing that was appropriate to wear riding.

Besides, even if she had been in the mood to ride, which truthfully she probably was, she wasn't going to satisfy her mother's sense of mission and duty to distract her today, but saddling up her favorite horse. She gave the chestnut horse a few gentle pats on his nose, before meeting her mother at the carriage.

They sat out, a train of two carriages, on the rough roads to the east woods. Her mother's companion rode with them in one carriage. Two servants rode with their provisions in another. A forestman and the warden rode alongside the train on horseback.

As they rocked and rattled over the roads, her mother chatted freely with her companion about all manner of things going on in the kingdom and the household. From time to time, her mother would lean across and pat the princess's arm, "Darling, cover your ears for this part," whenever the talk turned to some item of personal business that her mother deemed unsuitable for her.

The princess would half-heartedly comply, but really her mind was far away. In fact, her mind was wandering through the stories that Avalon often told her when she visited her. She found herself in other lands, some arid and dry, others nothing more than small islands dotting an exanse of water.

She could imagine the warriors that fought long dangerous battles in Avalon's stories. She could hear the whispers and intrigue inside the royal courts that always seemed more exciting and glamorous than the court she lived in.

When Avalon told her stories, new worlds opened up to the princess, worlds she could hardly fathom, and assumed she would never see in person, at least not until the distant future when young father and mother had passed on their titles became hers.

Assuming they did. Assuming she wanted them. That's what being with Avalon impressed upon her the most. There was more in the world than the household she lived in and all of the constraints that came along with that. She couldn't imagine giving up being a royal, of course, perhaps the most important royal family of them all. Her father was the Divine King, after all.

But even now as she rocked along on some winding but unbending route to the eastern woods, she couldn't help but let her imagination wander among those lands, those places, those people that seemed much more than this, whatever this was at the moment.

***

"Why don't you go exploring?" her mother said to her, as if she was still a little girl in plaited braids, full of dimples and cute sayings. Her mother was busy overseeing the servants setting up for lunch. The forestman and warden were busy trundling the heavy lunch table from spot to spot, trying to follow her mother's wayward gestures.

The princess sighed and decided to set off into the woods after all. She followed the trickling sound of the creek that flowed through the woods, half remembering that a rustic wooden bridge crossed the creek at some point.

The flood and flow of instructions from the picnic spot stared to give way to rustle of creatures in the forest bed, to bids chirping in the tress above.

"You actually like the woods," she said out loud to herself, a habit she associated with her younger self. She had put that habit away recently now that she was properly older and talking to yourself was not proper.

She replied silently: Yes but that was before and this is now.

Regardless, she felt a flutter of excitement upon seeing the bridge, remembering when crossing that bridge meant crossing to a new world, a new land. Maybe one of the land's from Avalon's stories. There had been a period of time when Avalon's stories did come to life around her in places like that, places that seemed different from some other place.

She stopped in the middle of the bridge, crouching down to watch the rippling current pass under her. Small fish darted along the sandy bottom that glistened in the sunlight. She saw a turtle making its way across the creek, opposite of the direction she was heading in.

Pausing, she studied its slow, persistent motions, watched it kick and glide its way across the creek's current. It didn't move with great urgency, but it made its way.

Once the turtle disappeared in the brush lining the creek, the princess continued across to the other side. When her feet touched the ground again, she suddenly remembered a grove of old trees where she would spent hours as a little girl. She wondered if she could remember where it was.

Up to this point, she had been following a very rough narrow trail, probably made by the woodsman or maybe people long before them who had wandered these woods. She knew from Avalon that these woods weren't always part of the estate. But those times seemed as far removed as the far away worlds in Avalon's stories.

The grove she remembered wasn't on the trail. She thought she needed to strike off to the left at some point. As she walked, she remembered a series of mossy boulders that had been the marker for her to turn. There were the rocks just up ahead.

Even now she could picture herself walking into deepest parts of the forest, the tree cover getting thicker, the world feeling very far away. But something was different. The way up ahead seemed much lighter than before. Up ahead and to the right, she realized that a road had been cut into the woods.

When she reached the road, she stopped and stared down the ragged, turning path it made. She couldn't tell exactly where it went. But it cut in the opposite direction too, towards the grove. She turned and followed the road.

The road was littered with splinted and split wood. Much of it was still relatively bright and fresh looking. "This road is still new," she said out loud.

As she reached the road's terminal point, she gasped. She gasped because she was walking into a clearing, a clearing that she had never seen before now. This clearing wasn't a pleasant meadow full of weedy grasses and grazing animals. It was barren and stumpy, littered with the remnants of the trees that had been chopped down and taken away.

"They've cut down the trees!" she cried out, out loud again. She replied in her mind: Of course they did. Where do you think they get wood for furniture and other things in the world?

She knew the counterpoint she raised was a reasonable one, but the realization hurt nonetheless. Seeing these razed trees just added to the corded up frustration she was already carrying today. She dropped to her knees and started to sob, letting the angry, frustrated tears flow freely.

***

She cried herself dry, and just knelt in the clearing, holding her face in her hands until a voice sounded out, "Why are you crying? Are you okay?"

She stood up and circled around, scanning the clearing of the voice that called out to her. She didn't see anyone and wondered if in her her current state she was hearing things.

Then she heard a branch break and a figure stepped into the clearer. The figure was really nothing more than a child, a boy, younger than her by several years, wearing a thin robe. His head was shaved, but already covered in a scruffy stubble, and he held onto to a coarse sack slung over his shoulder.

"Are you sure you're okay? I heard you crying."

The princess wiped at her eyes and nose, self-conscious of the color that had probably spread over her cheeks. She could almost hear her mother saying, "That's an ugly look you've got. Cheer up, darling." "I'm fine. And even if I wasn't it isn't any of your business."

The boy looked at her, turned his head and shrugged. "Okay, it sounded like you were pretty upset. I thought an animal was caught in a trap. I heard you crying from far away."

"I said I'm fine. "Why are you here?"

The boy scratched his head and then looked up at the sky, "Well that's a big a question. I don't know that I have time to answer that. Let me see..."

She cut him off, "I would like to know who are. You're trespassing in the King's lands."

"I am?" The boy looked around puzzled. "That's great!" In his enthusiasm he started off across the clearing, marching right past her.

"Wait! Stop! Where are you going?"

"I'm crossing the clearing. I got lost and wandered around for a long time, just hoping that I would end up where I was told to go. I really hope I'm not late."

"Late for what?" she asked, but the boy had already disappeared into the wood. She took off after her, leaving behind the spectacle of her sadness and grief among the stubble and stumps in the clearing.

She had to keep a quick pace to keep up with him. "Stop, please, stop."

The boy stopped in his tracks and turned to her, finally allowing her to ask again, "Where are you going?

"Well, I'm really not supposed to say."

"So it's a secret."

"Kind of, yes. I would say it's a secret."

"What if I command you to tell me?"

The boy erupted in a laugh that doubled him over, "Command me? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. You can't command someone to tell a secret." Then the boy became reflective and stared at her intensely, "Can you?"

"Well I am a princess, so I believe that I can, yes."

"You're a princess? I've never met a real princess before." He started circling around her.

"There aren't any princesses where you're from, wherever you're from?"

"No, not that I'm aware. No princesses. There's are other people that give orders and tell others what to do, but no princesses."

"So I take it you're not one of these, how did you put it, 'people who tell other people what to do'?"

"Not really. Well, maybe... Not yet."

"What kind of answer is that? I'm completely confused by you. You are the most confusing boy I've ever met."

"I apologize. You're not the first person to say that to me."

Now that he was closer to her, the princess how tightly his skin stretched over his round face. The sun had turned his skin darker than hers. His finger nails were unkempt and dirty. He had a look of being generally disorderly and not well cared for.

And yet here he was wandering the world, wandering into her world, on the King's lands with some kind of secret purpose that he refused to share with her.

The boy's stomach grumbled, "I need to keep walking, I don't want to be late."

They started walking again, though the boy's pace was slower than before, "Are you hungry? Thirsty?" she asked him.

"I'm starving but I don't have time to waste. I made a promise and I have to keep that promise."

"But surely that promise should allow for tending to your basic needs. It doesn't sound like a very good promise that won't allow you to eat or sleep or other things to keep living. How will you fulfill your promise if you can't survive?"

"That's a good point. I really am hungry. Do you have anything to eat?"

"I don't..." the boy's face sank in disappointment, "But I know where to get food."

"Is it far away?"

"No it's very close."

"How close?"

"Just down this path. There is a another clearing, a proper clearing, along the creek."

"And there is food there? What kind of place is this? Is this a magical forest?"

"No silly, it's the King's Forest. The Eastern Forest to be exact. It's not magical, not in that way."

"Then why is there food just laying around in the woods? It's not just a bunch of mushrooms is it? I can't stand mushrooms. That's all I've eaten for days. That and a few birds eggs."

The princess tried to imagine this boy climbing up a tree to steal bird eggs. It was surprisingly easy to image this happening. "My mother is there, setting up a picnic. We brought too much food for just the two of it. You're welcome to some if it, if you'd like it."

"I would love that. Let's walk faster. Faster walking, sooner eating. That's my motto."

The princess assumed that it wasn't, in fact, his motto, but she smiled at the spirit anyway, and picked up her pace to try to stay abreast with the little boy who was barreling down the wooded path.

***

They startled her mother as they came crashing through the woods and entered the picnic spot. Her mother gasped, one of the servants nearly dropped a tray. The princess scanned the spot, only her mother, her mother's companion and the servant remained. The forestman and the warden were no longer part of the party.

"Darling, where have you been, and who in the world do you have with you?"

"I was wandering in the woods, just as you told me do." She decided not to share with her mother the news about the clearing at this time. "And this... This is..."

"Oh, my name is Leif," the boy said.

The princess nudged him and whispered, "Your majesty."

"But I'm not a majesty," the boy replied at full volume, clearly confused by what she meant.

"No, her, my mother. She's the queen. Say you're majesty and bow."

The boy's eyes were even wider than when he had learned she was a princess, "You're a queen. Pleased to meet you you're majesty. I've never met a real life Queen before."

"That's quite alright and to be expected," her mother replied. The princess was already annoyed at the tone that her mother was taking.

"Leif has been traveling and is hungry. I invited him to picnic with us."

"With us? Why I don't know dear."

The princess rushed forward she sat on knees before her mother, in a pose of daughterly pleading. "Please mother, he seems very good natured and so very hungry. Think of the good it will do."

It wasn't clear, even to her, what kind of good feeding the boy would do exactly, but she could see that her appeal to doing good in the world struck a chord with her mother. In a hushed tone her mother replied, "That is fine dear. We will make a place for him to eat, but over there."

"No! Mother! He must eat with us."

"I was hoping for a pleasant picnic with my daughter..."

"Mother..."

"Fine. Very well, I am much much too pliable a parent. Wouldn't you agree?" she asked her lady's companion, who nodded and replied with a terse, "Yes, my lady. But in bending, you model the true meaning of grace for your daughter."

"I had not considered it in that light." her mother replied. The princess know that her mother always looked positively on opportunities to school her in the correct courtly manner. Her mother's upbringing, by her own telling, had been marked by many such lessons and had led to her consider rise in station and status. Presumably she carried the same expectations for her daughter, to marry well and advance the family's name.

Her mother looked over her should at the boy and said, "Young man, my daughter says that you are hungry, please come join us for our picnic."

"I would love to!" the boy dashed forward, stopped himself, bowed in a halting way, and added, "Your majesty."

***

The boy was either masterfully evasive or much too hungry to answer questions in a clear manner. As they ate on the spread out linens covering the grass by the creek, they chattered and discussed and gossiped, but he remained very quiet. Not exactly quiet, the princess observed. He made a terrible ruckus and mess when he ate, in part because every bit he took had an attending commentary.

After several attempts to draw him out and reveal more details about himself, her mother finally gave up and turned her attention to her companion. The princess scooted herself closer to the boy so they could talk more privately without the adults overhearing what they were saying.

"Do you want to know why I was crying?" she asked him.

He took another bite of the cold roast quail and nodded his head, "Of course. I wouldn't have asked," he said through his bites of food.

"It was the trees."

"The trees?" he seemed puzzled. "I didn't see any trees."

"That's my point. That's why I was crying. That used to be a grove of very special trees, at least to me when I was younger. Now they're gone."

The boy had stopped eating, "What happened to them?"

"Cut down, I assume. Didn't you see the tree stumps and broken branches everywhere?"

"I was too distracted by your crying"

"That's not a nice thing to say."

"I didn't mean anything by it."

She settled the play of anger that crossed into her voice, "It's fine. I didn't know that the trees had been cut down. I was surprised, and I...I don't know, I just started to cry."

"Do you feel better?"

"I guess. I don't know. I would feel better if the trees had not been cut down."

The boy stared off past her at the creek as it bubbled along past them.

"What are you look at?"

"The creek. The water. Do you ever wonder if the water knows where it is going?"

The princess turned to watch the water. "I've never really considered it."

"It's carried along by something it doesn't really understand, but it keeps flowing, keeps being water either way."

The princess looked at him, not quite sure what the say. Where had this observation come from? He seemed so careless, even carefree about the world around him. She had spent countless hours watching these waters pass her by and had never thought anything like that before. He was the strangest little boy she had ever met.

***

The picnic was over and her mother announced it was time to return to the house. Returning meant starting the early evening rituals that took place before dinner. The princess knew that she had nothing to look forward to but another round of washing and dressing, being handled by her maid, a long dinner with any guests or courtiers were still lingering about the house. Then even an even longer time spent in the parlor with her mother and the other ladies.

She detested playing cards, and could only read for a brief time before the parlor's heat and the dull atmosphere put her to sleep. Then her mother would inevitably scold her for dozing off like a common laborer on the side of the road. "It is, and certainly will be, your duty to inject life and vitality into whatever situation you find yourself in. As the betters of so many, so many will look to you. You are a..."

Spark, madam," her companion would invariably interject.

"Yes, precisely. A spark. And those in your company are just cords of wood waiting to be lit by you. Don't you understand, dear?"

Some version of this conversation had played out so many time, so many nights. The princess could immerse herself in the scene just sitting her in the rattling carriage. The only thing that pulled her out of this reverie of tedium was listening to the boy's excited conversations from the outside the carriage.

Her mother refused to allow the boy the ride inside with them. "He is too common, darling. I simply cannot allow it."

The princess knew that her mother would not budge. Sitting together with the boy in the rustic woods, eating their rustic picnic was one matter. She could only imagine the scene of horror her mother conjured as she imagined returning home, exiting the carriage, and meeting the servants, whose job was the greet them and ease their way inside, and their puzzled look.

"He says he has somewhere to be and doesn't want to be late."

"While I commend the young man for wanting to be punctual, I hardly see how it is our responsibility to aid him with managing his time."

"Mother, you are taking this too literally."

"Literal? Well what other way is there to take it. I am merely responding to the situation you have brought before me, the exact one, unless you mean something else."

"No mother," she replied, huffing under her breath. She was already growing tired of debating this point with her mother.

Her mother's companion leaned in again and whispered something in her mother's ear. "Yes, yes, I suppose I could allow that. Fine, seeing as how today's themes seem to be grace and charity, we can permit him to ride atop the carriage."

She turned to tell the boy the good news, but suddenly couldn't find him. Maybe he had wandered off already. She paced around the picnic site, but found him sitting against a tree, starting to doze off.

She nudged his shoulder, "My mother says you can come with us. It's okay?"

The boy spoke through his yawn, "That's great news. Where are we going?"

"Home. To my home. I thought you said, you had somewhere to be. I thought you had some important secret appointment."

"Yes! and I can't be late. Does your carriage go fast?"

"As fast as a one horse carriage can travel on the roads we have this far out. Not fast, but fast enough."

"Well I can't complain. Besides I can hardly move a muscle after that lunch. I don't think I've ever seen that much food before."

Judging by the boy's look and how he had devoured so much food, the princess believed him.

"Darling, do close your sun shade," her asked. The princess realized that the late afternoon sun was starting to spread its bright light around them and through the carriage window on her side. She drew the shade, but not before realizing that they were close to home. They were crossing through one of the fields that was farmed. She could see lthe outlines of laborers in the fields swinging tools, stooping to pick and lift and drag.

With the shade drawn, the carriage was much darker. She leaned her head against the side of the carriage, closing her eyes to ride out the bumps and jostles until their day's journey ended.

Then she heard the driver call out and stern, "Whoa now." The carriage lurched to a stop.

"What's going on? Why are we stopping?" her mother asked.

The princess shrugged, having not more information that she did. She assumed that her mother was worried about bandits. She always fretted about bandits, even when they were traveling on their estate, on the King's lands.

She turned her head to the side of the carriage with the open window and suddenly met with the boy's upside down face.

"There are travelers up ahead, so we stopped."

The boy's face disappeared before he could hear her mother whisper to her companion, "Must be the priests. They typically arrive in a procession."

They sat still for several minutes in the middle of road. Suddenly she could hear horse hoofs pounded alongside then past them. The warden or forestman must be riding ahead. The travelers, even if they were priests, would have to give the right of way to the monarch's carriage, even though the monarch wasn't technically inside the carriage.

She could hear the reins crack and the driver give a little "Hiyah" Then they started to move again. As they approached the travelers, she peeled back the edge of the curtain to get a better look at the people who had parted to let them pass.

Much to her disappointment, though, she couldn't tell much about the figures lining the road. They were dressed in robes and many of them were hooded. They kept their heads low and faces out of site. Their robes were not uniform. Some were more or less plain than others. None were particularly lavish, nothing like her father's ceremonial robes.

She could only guess that these figures were in fact priests, the priests who had disrupted her day and kept her from Avalon. She didn't really know though, because she had never been allowed to see the priests up close before. And it had only been recently that she understood that there was some kind of connection between the priests and AValon.

The nature of that connection was a complete mystery to her. She never really considered why this connection was a myster. had someone forgot to tell her? Was she being lied to? Or had she just never stopped to think much about it.

Crosing through this parted stream of travelers though but the question at the forefront of her thoughts. But those forming thoughts were jostled out of her when the carriage came to a sudden halt. She pitched back into the cushions behind her. Her mother and her mother's companion lurched forward.

"Goodness, what is happening out there!?" her mother cried out.

"We're being stopped, my lady," the driver replied.

"Stopped by who?"

The driver didn't reply, or if he did, his response was drowned out by another voice. A loud, stern, deep voice that also cried out, "What were you thinking!? Get down from the carriage at once!"

The passengers in the carriage looked at each other, utterly confused. The princess pulled open the curtain, blinded momentarily by the surge of light that flooded in the interior. She poked her head out to see a tall man, one of the passengers, leading the boy away from the carriage, grabbing him by the collar, jerking along to the side of the road.

Moments later someone was rapping at the carriage door. Her mother's companion opened the door. The man she saw was now in full view, filling the door's frame.

He was severe and sharp angled. Old, but not weak like the old laborers and servants she was used to seeing. This man was old but vital. Regal, but not royal. She also noticed that his robes were much finer than many of the others she had seen. The also wore some kind of amulet close against his chest that peeked out from the tops of his clothes.

"Your majesty, allow me to apologize."

"High Priest, please explain yourself. I nearly suffered an injury for all of this jostling about on the road."

"Again, I apolgoize your majesty. There has been a most unusual occurance, a deviation from our forms and codes. Please be assured that the trangresser will be punished."

"Who are you talking about?" the princess interjected. Her mother was pleased.

The man locked eyes with her. In that moment, she could feel that she had been studied, ascertained. He nodded his head at her, "Your highness. We have only met through the stories the King and Queen have shared. I regret that our first meeting had occur under these circumstances."

"Please explain yourself," her mother cut in.

"The boy, the boy on our carriage. Where did you find him?"

"My daughter met him in the woods. He seemed like a troubled soul in need of nourishment and care. So we offered him our charity."

"A noble instinct, of course." Her mother's companion nodded knowingly at this comment. "But that...that boy isn't just a boy."

"Then who is he? Plesae do not leave us in the dreadful suspense," her mother replid.

"Of course. He is the newest, and youngest member, of my order."

The princess blurted out, "You mean he is a priest."

"That is exactly what I mean your highness. A priest of only a month, and still new, very new, to our ways, but a priest nonetheless."

Her mother chuckled, which seemed natural, if a little indecorous, "But he's just a boy!"

"Yes, I am afraid so. But the priesthood is in just a state these days that we must take the candidates we are given. He was the only candidate put forth by his people. But he should have known that we are charged with a solemn duty to perform and are not mingle with people of the world until that duty is discharged. I hesitate to say it, but he was put everything our duty bounds us to do at risk."

"Well, please know, that had I known, I...we would never have."

"Of course not your Majesty, please understand that I do not blame you. But I'm afraid we are losing day, and losing time. We have many tasks to perform, as you well know. We must be on our way."

"As must we, there are household matters to attend to."

"Very well. I take my leave and promise that the boy will not be a concern of yours anymore."

"I am pleased to hear it. Driver? Driver? Carry on and take us home, please."

The carriage starting rolling again. The princess fell back into her seat, still staring out the window. As they passed the contingent of priests, she could help but look for the boy. There he was, held in place by the High Priest's firm grip on his shoulder.

She caught his eyes just before they were too far out of sight. He looked as miserable as she felt right now.

# Chapter 2: The Space Between #

Dinner that night proved to be even more agonizing than usual. The princess made her appearance as she was obligated to do, at the time she was obligated to appear.

The only motivation she could muster inside was a strong desire to know if the High Priest would be a dining with them that night. She wasn't so much interested in the High Priest himself, though she was curious what her assessment of her had been, but wanted to hear more about the boy.

It would be right to say that she had been fretting from the time she returned home to the time she stepped foot in the long narrow dining room, but she could feel a constant tug of anxiety and concern in the back of her mind. That subtle yet gnawing sensation had made it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything and made time pass more slowly than usual.

The priests had vanished from view once they arrived on the grounds. She wondered where they could be going, and what important business they were attending to. As she had earlier in the day, she started to marvel over the fact that she either had never noticed, or never taken much interest in the contingent of robed figures who would appear at their house on some semi-regular basis.

Certainly she knew that the priests existed and knew that they were a very secretive order. She knew that her father relied on them in some capacity in his role as king, but she could not even begin to formulate what this interaction must look like.

Mulling over what little information she did have, she had decisively come to the conclusion that the little boy was an unlikely candidate to be a priest. The priests they passed on the road seemed so removed form life, so rigid and formal. The High Priest, in particular, seemed of this world, but also stood apart from it.

Perhaps that's why she wondered what he had made of her when he fixed his gaze upon her. She couldn't say it words, but instinctively knew that he was judging her by some criteria that she could not access and did not know, maybe could not know.

She wondered which parts of himself that little boy would have to trim away, like a gardener at a hedgerow, to become the kind of priest who wouldn't be pressed down by someone like the High Priest.

Once in the dining room, with the service about to being, she felt her interest in the proceedings diminish when she saw that the guests were just some minor official, a judge, and a some lesser nobleman and his wife.

Throughout the dinner she followed the protocols that she knew almost instinctively now. She feigned interest when it seemed that she should, and disengaged when it was clear the guests were speaking of subjects that didn't include her.

As the princess, the guests around her felt obliged to engage in some brief back and forth, which usually amounted to questions about her education or reading, or about the house and grounds. She wasn't inclined to talk much about the former, and didn't care to know much about the later.

So after a few awkward volleys, the guest would usually shrug and turn back to the table's conversation, satisfied that they had done their duty as guests in the King's house to engage his daughter. If nothing else, this would allow each on to say later over nightcaps or a game of cards, "Yes, a perfectly charming young woman. You must be so proud." At which point the adults would nod in agreement, and move on to other concerns.

Over the course of the service, she had become so lulled into the routine of feigning and disengaging that she didn't hear her mother addressing a direct question to her, something her mother rarely, if never, did in these formal settings. "Dear, remind us how you came across the boy."

Putting on her most agreeable princess demeanor, she replid, "The boy? Mother"

"Yes, the young priest. The judge was just asking about him, having heard previously before about the youngest priest to even be accepted into the order."

"Yes, I was telling your mother that if it weren't for the writings and decisions of one of most revered jurists of the last generation, the young man would not have been considered for the spot. Naturally, being a man of the law, I take great interest when legal theory materializes in the practical."

"We were in the eastern forest, as I'm sure mother has already explained. I was talking a walk. I came upon a grove I remembered visiting as a little girl. I was surprised to find that it had been cut down and the trees removed from the forest."

"What that old cyprus grove?" her father interjected. "We had those trees removed months ago. Had I known you had an attachment to the spot, I would have told your sooner."

She didn't care to hear more of an explanation about the trees and their fate. "Yes, father. As I said, I was surprised to see the trees gone and then there he was, asking me if I was okay."

"Why wouldn't you have been okay, dear?" her mother asked, but moved along the conversation when her daughter didn't reply. "You see the boy just wandered onto the estate. We had no idea who he was until we encountered the High Priest."

"The boy didn't tell you who he was?" the lesser nobleman asked.

"No, isn't that the strangest thing."

"In my limited experience, the priests observe their own ways closely, and care little for ours," the official said.

"My great-uncle was part of the priesthood, for a time," the nobleman's wife interjected. Even the princess knew that this nobleman's wife came from a disgraced family, so it was a surprise that she brought up and branch of it at all.

"Certainly my experience today has spoken to their strange ways," her mother concluded.

"You must remember my love that the priests bear a heavy burden and perform an important role. We must honor and respect their desire to protect their customs."

"But what will happen to him?" the princess blurted, almost interrupting her father, which was frowned up, especially during formal events like this, and around his subjects.

"Happen?" her father replied, tilting his head in confusion. "Why I suppose after the have finished their tasks that he will be punished."

The magistrate added, "The priests are known for their creative punishments."

"But why? Why punish him at all?" she cried out. "Did he really do anything that wrong? He's just a child."

"But, he is a priest," the magistrate replied. "His life is bound up with a different set of rules than ours. Those rules were broken. That is the logic that law follows...theirs and ours." The judge nodded his approval, affirming that the law did, in fact, work this way.

The princess tried to not be visibly upset. She could not tell how effectively she was doing this. Perhaps not that well. Her father stepped in to halt the conversation any further, "You must put this aside, it is no concern of ours what happens to this boy, this priest. Let us close this matter up."

"I agree," her mother added. "We need space between us and this unpleasant subject."

The princess knew she could not leave the table, not without breaching more protocol than she already did. She knew her father, who generally was an indulgent father, was barely tolerating her transgression just now.

***

The princess awoke the next morning to a dark room, even after the chambermaid had pulled back heavy curtains covering her windows. "It will be a gray day today, your highness," the maid commented.

The princess turned over in bed, shutting out the windows, and buried her head in her pillow. She opened one forcefully shut eye and saw the chambermaid's blurry outline standing alongside the bed. The chambermaid had her hands crossed, and very meekly said, "Should I have the house mistress tell your mother you're not well, princess?"

The princess closed her open eye, squeezed both tightly together, considered the matter, and said, "Yes, I'm not well this morning."

The chambermaid replied a soft, "Very well" and quietly left the room, leaving the princess to the silent contours of her dark, gray room.

She lost track of how long she lay there, tossing back and forth. She wasn't comfortable. It didn't feel like a luxury to be laying there broken out the household's pace. Her back ached and her head too. A daytime heat rose up through her body, which would have been pleasant during a nighttime chill, but now just irritated and agitated her.

She bolted up in bed just as her mother walked in with the house mistress. Her mother began buzzing about her room, making offhand observations, "I must come in your chambers more often...this table is much too shabby...make a note that we must replace these lamps with something else. I can't bear to look at them..."

The house mistress dutifully followed her mother, recording these observations in a notebook she kept around her neck, suspended him a braided silver chain.

They stopped at the foot of her bed. "Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better," her mother said. "I have very exciting news for you."

The princess rubbed her hands through the thick dark tangle of her hair. "What's the news?" She was already convinced that it wouldn't be exciting enough to rouse her out of her agitated state.

"The priests are completing their rituals and by all accounts they have been very successful." As she said this, the princess wondered what this meant, and if her mother knew what this meant. "So, your father, at my request, has approved hosting a ball, here, tomorrow night. We are already making plans. Invitations are being sent by couriers as we speak. Isn't this simply wonderful news? It's been far too long since we've hosted a ball."

The princess had vague memories of previous balls where she had been trundled around like a small object of great value, passed through the hands of visitors from different corners of the kingdom. Remarked upon, marveled at when she performed some cute trick that children inevitably learn to dazzle the adults in the room.

"And for you, darling, it's been much too long. I realize only now how cruel it has been to keep you out of society. Your father and I have been much too wrapped up in the kingdom's business. But that all changes, starting today." Her mother paused, "And listen, listen here. I promise you that will have more of my attention during this very important transition in your life. Not just your life. All of our lives. We need to properly introduce you to society and lay the groundwork for what comes next."

"What comes next?" the princess asked.

"Adulthood, marriage. Titles. Everything. Just as I experienced. You will experience, only on a much grander scale. I will be sure of that."

"Mother, it's too early to have my life plotted out for me. Can we wait until after luncheon?"

"Too early? It feels like we're positively wasting the day. Come now, it's time to get up. There's so much to do."

"Uggh, fine. But when can I see, Avalon? It's been far too long."

Her mother, who was about to leave her room, turned back and said in a feigned whisper, "Well, I wasn't supposed to say this, but there is a chance that you will be able to see Avalon at the ball."

***

Her mother kept her by her side for much of the day. Together they oversaw many of the preparations being made for the ball. Servants criss-crossed across the house, carrying linens, bringing fine wines from the cellar. Everywhere the princess looked servants were cleaning, dusting, polishing.

It had been several years since she had seen the ballroom, the topmost floor of the grand house's central wing. When she was much younger, her governess at the time would allow her to romp in the large space, lined with windows, when the weather didn't allow them to be outside.

Her governess at the time had extolled exposure to nature. Her mother had been reluctant at first, but came to understand that this method of education was becoming more fashionable among in the elites in the kingdom. Not wanting to be outdone, it seemed like there was a period of time when the princess lived much of her waking life outside.

It was also a period of time when she remembered Avalon truly entering her life, at least in a meaningful way. It was during these outdoor sessions that she had encountered Avalon with her governess, and formed an attachment to this person who had come to play such an important role in her life.

That governess had been released for some reason, the family's "relationship" as her mother had called it had come to an end. It was the beginning of a period of time when she saw Avalon more and governesses less. Occasionally a tutor in one subject or another would appear in her life, then readily disappear, partly due to the fact that she started to understand how to dispatch the people who were supposed to educate her, which then led to her having more time to spend in what ever way she chose.

The princess didn't feel that her education suffered much because of her tactics. She probably didn't grasp the subtleties of several dead languages, but she felt that she had learned so much about the world from Avalon. Besides, she wondered, certainly then, perhaps less so now, what a princess needed with stuffy tutors and their rote rehearsals of whatever subject matter they had mastered in their own youth.

Even though she had not been in the ballroom for years, it still seemed like a grand space. Though the weather prevented the space from being lit up and luminous with sunlight, the space still seemed large and took what light there was a turned it into magic. Even the columns of dust that swirled in the faint light seemed to glitter like a rare substance.

Perhaps it was a callback of her younger feelings about the space, about the governess, and Avalon, of those days when her life and, more importantly, her feelings about her life, were simpler, but she felt a ping of excitement course through her. She started to see the counters of the high vaulted ceiling in a different way, and could imagine the sounds of music and voices and dancing feet as they would curl about those vaults and resonate with a rich sound.

She started to trace out the lines in the intricate wooden floor, following the tracks of light and dark wood, hopping from diamond shape to square, with a combination of her natural and learned grace. The movement quickened her body, her cares started to feel further away. She begrudgingly admitted to herself that she was looking forward to the ball.

This excitement didn't completely blot out her concerns about the boy and her frustration over not seeing Avalon, but maybe the later issue would be resolved soon. As for the boy, perhaps, she started to argue with himself, he really did deserve any punishments that the priests administered. Maybe he had done something sever enough to deserve his treatment, or at least maybe she didn't know enough to say for sure.

This line of thinking took root in her mind as the day progressed, right until she was put into the hands of her mother's dressmaker. The dressmaker lived in a nearby village and been rushed to the estate to ready the Queen and Princess for the ball.

The princess spent several hours perched on top of a wobbling box in front of a mirror, twisting round and round. Pins seemed to thread in and out around her body at every imaginable angle.

It was too late to construct a new gown; so her and her mother would have to make due with taking a dress and altering it. In the princesss's case, the servants were able to bring down from storage several gowns that the princess had never worn, did not even recognize. Her mother, apparently, had been buying gowns for her without her event realizing it, storing them for an occasion when she might need them.

The dressmaker had to mend to dress to make it fit properly. Then she began ruching and pleating, pulling and pressing to change the dress' look. "And you're sure this is the style now?"

"Yes, my lady. I make it a point to keep up with the evolution of styles around the capital. Knowing that I may be called on in a situation exactly like this one."

The dressmaker's reply gave her mother great satisfaction. Her mother often bemoaned being so far from fashionable life in other parts of the kingdom. They spent so much of their time on her father's estate, where he preferred to spend his time. Because of this, the estate became the de facto court, and life in the kingdom shifted accordingly. At least this was the explanation that her mother would give when she was lamenting this facet of her life. "Not that I am not extremely privileged in other ways," her mother would add, not completely unaware that the Queen enjoyed privileges that many others did not.

***

By the next day, the princess' mood and outlook had changed considerably. She was genuinely looking forward to the ball, though not particularly keen on her mother's constant allusions to her entering society. One the thing the princess did not want was to feel that this society's eyes were watching her every move. She didn't feel ready to address herself to this being, this thing that her mother portrayed as being everywhere and everything all at once.

The princess felt that she was excited on her own terms. Not society's. Not her mother's. So she would enjoy the ball for what it was. By tomorrow, much of the turmoil she experienced the last few days would feel like a distant memory. The only problem she faced now was that the evening couldn't come soon enough.

Her mother did not want the princess with her like she did yesterday. This actually came as something of a relief, because her mother was controlled by her nerves now. Everything seemed to be teetering on the edge of disaster or coming together better than she could have hoped. She watch her mother bound these hills of despair and elation, being totally ignored by her, several times before she decided to slip away and roam the gardens outside.

The sun was shining again. The air was starting to feel cooler and crisp, but it was still warm enough to enjoyed ambling through the gardens.

She walked aimlessly for a while before deciding to walk by the hothouses where the gardeners cultivated flowers. Her father took a great interest in cultivating flowers, even hosted several competitions for other like himself. Even though he inevitably won these competitions, he was so deeply interested in the subject, that he barely seemed to notice that he had won. His inattention to this fact made the event tolerable for the other participants.

As she crossed the lawn to the hothouse, she realized that she would ask for help assembling a bouquet for Avalon, for when she saw her finally. She knew that Avalon loved flowers. When she would walk with Avalon and the governess, they would often steer their course to the hothouse to admire what was growing there.

She entered through the metal and glass door, letting the heat and humidity inside envelope her. She had almost felt chilly walking outside before entering. Now her clothes started to feel heavy and awkward. One of the gardeners greeted her. She started to approach him to make her request, but then noticed an unexpected figure down at the opposite end deeply examining the plants there.

The princess told the gardener she would return and walked closer to the figure, who she realized was the High Priest. She would not have assumed that a person like this would be admiring flowers the way he was.

The high priest looked up and noticed her before she could acknowledge him, "Ah, your highness. I didn't know that you were interested in the gardening and flowers."

"I was just passing through really...to ask the gardeners to cut a bouquet of flowers for me."

"Ah, yes, of course. Cut flowers do make for a pretty sight in one's room."

She felt dismissed by this remark and it bothered her. Why did this high priest seem to treat her like some kind of object under glass, something to be observed and commented upon? Was she doing something to invite this scrutiny?

"They do, but these are not for me."

The high priest leaned forward to more closely examine one of the flowers before him, he breathed in the flower's fragrance more deeply. "Who are they for?"

This seemed like a very forward question, but she felt compelled to answer him, to justify herself for some reason. "For my friend, for Avalon."

"Avalon? Do you see her often?"

"Not as much any more. But whenever I can, I visit with her."

"And the King and Queen approve of these visits?"

"I suppose they do." She decided to counter with a bold question of her own, "Why are asking these questions."

The High Priest drew up to full height, breathing in the air around him with a deep satisfied gulp. "Amazing isn't. So many flowers in this hothouse, so many fragrances, all releasing their scents into their air, all blending together. And yet I can still identify the scent of this flower here, it smells so particular and it lingers. And yet this flower, this particular species relies on..." he scanned the area around them then pointed out another type of flower, "...that one in order to pollinate and survive. So unique, yet so bound to what is around it."

He looked around, taking note of the workers in the hothouse that were nearby, "Please come walk with me." They left the hothouse with him guiding her by the arm, not forcefully, but his will seemed to channel itself through his touch. There was no mistaking that she was supposed to follow him and his direction. "I want to show you something."

They walked into one of the small orchards of fruit trees that had been planted generations ago. Another priest stood at the edge of the orchard, seemingly standing watch. The High Priest passed him without acknowledging him at all.

The princess tried to catch the priests' attention, trying to get some piece of information to orient herself with. But, much like on the road before, the priest keep his eyes concealed, unmoved by whatever wild look of desperation might have passed her face.

The trees never bore much fruit, just enough for pleasant fall time snacks. Most of the fruit had been harvested weeks before, leaving only the smell of sweet sour rotting fruit. She had to hop over the mushy masses that were left, even after the pigs had routed through the remains.

The walked to the center of the orchard. As they grew closer, she could hear faint groans. Then she saw the boy laying on his side, clutching his stomach, groaning. She tried to rush forward to tend to him, but the priest's firm hand held her back.

"No, this is his punishment." She looked up at him. "Did you think he would be lashed or stoned. No, he is a priest, not a common criminal, but he needed to be punished."

"What did you do to him?"

"He was made to eat these rotted apples until I deemed he had enough."

"But he's sick now. He looks miserable."

"Yes and hopefully this young boy will carry this lesson forward with him."

"And that lesson is?"

"As priests, we are of this world, but not a part of it. We stand a part from it. And must not break that vow."

"Why is this code so important? What does it matter?"

"That is a question that I cannot answer here. But I will say this. When I look at you, I see a young person, on the verge of adulthood, full of so much potential..."

She must have given him a surprised look, because he stopped and added. "Yes, princess, I see potential in you, potential to be a great monarch, a wise ruler. But I also see currents in you that trouble me. I would never want the monarchy and priesthood to come into conflict. That would upset long standing understanding. You, this boy, even Avalon, yes, your precious Avalon, all have a role to play in that understanding, even though you don't realize it yet."

"I can't say more, but know that your actions from today forward, have great import, more meaning than you may realize. So the next time you meet one of my priests in a forest clearing, do not invite him to picnic, no matter your personal feelings. Your personal feelings are like these rotted apples to a priest, only foul spoilings that will leave us sick and twisted, not like a priest at all. Do you understand?"

The princess nodded, wincing slightly under his grip, which never loosened from her shoulder, and maybe even grew tighter as he delivered this speech or warning or threat to her.

***

She thought about the High Priest's speech as she prepared for the ball. Her maid asked her several times if she was feeling any better. "I'm fine, thank you," was her curt reply.

She hoped that the boy would be okay and would recover from his punishment. She supposed that being forced to eat rotten apples would make him sick, but surely he would recover.

More than this, she puzzled over what the priest said about roles and connections between things. How could her world be connected to his at all?

Another train of thought nagged at her concerning Avalon. For the past several years, Avalon had been such a fixture in her life. Avalon would come and go, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time. She never really explained where she had gone or what she had done. These trips, however, never interrupted their afternoon walks, or rainy mornings spent in Avalon's rooms listening to stories.

Yet recently the space between them seemed to widen. Most recently Avalon had been missing for over a month, the longest time the princess remembered her being gone for. And now she desperately wanted to see her, and she was only a few hours away from doing so.

Her anticipation and longing helped soften her attitude and tolerate her maid's meek ministrations that her maid delivered. Finally the last of the rings was set on her slender fingers and the maid stepped away to let the princess admire herself in the mirror.

The princess held out a hand, asking without words, to be helped up out of chair. She walked over to the mirror to fully asses herself. The dressmaker had made the dress more presentable, perhaps the detailing along the bodice was a little fussy and distracting. The princess did prefer plain, but well made things, but she could not argue that the gown had a certain fit and finish.

She twirled side to side several times trying to assess the gown's full effect. Finally pleased by what she saw, she said to her maid, "You may leave now."

The maid curtseyed and took her leave to join the other servants as they made their final preparations for the ball. The princess remained in her room, pacing nervously hoping that the hour would arrive when something could actually happen, instead of endlessly waiting for it to happen.

Finally someone knocked on her door. It wasn't a knock she was used to, perhaps a new servant. She said loudly, "Come in."

She did not expect to see her father standing in her doorway. He was medium height, but looked like a strong man, even when just a dark outline in the doorway.

"Father?" I didn't expect to see you there. The princess made a deferential bow to him.

"I didn't mean to surprise you. I thought I should take this opportunity to escort you down to the main hall where we will receive our guests."

She smiled at her father and said, "I would like that."

Her father, the King, was a serious man, took his role as King seriously. He diligently read his briefings and documents, responded promptly to his councillors, weighed matters of state deliberately, and so on.

In her mind, he was a good kind, the model of a king. He could be inflexible and unbending, but she assumed this would be the case for her if she were ever monarch. No one to say know to you. How did he manage to maintain his sense of proportion about things? Rather than being swept up in the trappings of his station, he seemed to accept things as matter of fact, and work hard to ensure their presense in his and his children's lives.

They walked together down her wing of the house to the where the grand central staircase rose to unite the various parts of the house. At this point, her father was mostly silent, having used up all of the small talk he had stored up to use with her. Typically in these situations, he wouldn't know what to say and would prefer to be silent than the say frivolous words.

In this way, she thought, her father and mother seemed like such opposites, such an unlikely pairing. But she remembered that often in their royal lives forces beyond their control could end up shaping what, for other people, were deeply personal decisions. Not so for them. Or so she had been told.

***

Despite the ball being announced in such a haphazard way, the guests seemed too numerous for the princess to count. She was able to recall or remember the first handful of guests that arrived. After that, she lost track of the faces, the dresses, the compliments.

Much to her mother's delight there was small selection of eligible matches for the princess to engage with during the night. Some a little younger than herself, most significantly older. Regardless of their status or disposition towards her and the prospect of wooing her, each became a willing dance partner for a turn or two, before swirling off to engage in other pursuits.

During much of the ball, the guests crowded the edges of the ballroom, while the dance floor saw a steady flow of gowns and long tailed coats, feet tapping and scraping their way across the intricate patterns in even more intricate patterns of arched arms and sweeping legs.

Half way through, the princess had to take a break. She was flushed and could feel sweat starting to roll down the angles of her shoulder blades. She sat and felt content and chatted merrily with the guests around her.

She knew that her mother was very satisfied with her comportment and bearing. She caught her mother chatting with the coteries of ladies around her, each one nodding approvingly in her direction. Each one had been in a situation similar to hers at some point. She could only imagine the stories and memories they were sharing and reliving together in that huddle of finery.

The musicians began to play again and dancers found partners and began to assemble on the dance floor. The tune and tempo dictating a line dance, with the dancers pairing up as they criss crossed the floor, then remerged back in to the line.

As the princess took her place in the line of other ladies dancing this round, she could hear the mood of the room shift. Somehow, all at once, everyone's attention shifted to a new center of gravity. The princess looked around to understand what was distracting everyone from the dance floor, which normally was the center of attention for a ball.

Then she realized what had happened. She realized the moment that she brought her own attention back to the lines before her and looked across to see an unlikely dance partner. The king had joined the dance, standing directly across from her.

The tittering and talk in the room caused the musicians to stop their tunings momentarily. The king, smiling generously at the all of the attention washing over him, gestured for the room to quiet down, which it did almost immediately. He nodded to the lead musician. The musicians harmonized their instruments and began to play.

The music moved at a brisk pace. It had intricate timing, and sometimes the tempo would change suddenly, signaling a new formation or movement in the dance. Dancing in this way required the dancer's complete concentration to fully appreciate the directions being give them.

The musicians were skilled enough to not just blindly lead the dancers along, but to respond to the dancers as well. A couple who seemed too attached might cause a rapid shift in the music to indicate that it was time to pair up again, or another pairing might catch and hold the room's attention, causing the musicions to stretch out the theme a little longer.

Certainly, they responded to the moment when she finally crossed paths with her father. The music seemed to change entirely, signaling that they would be dancing with these partners for a while. Indeed, every eye was on them as they held their dancing poses, bowing, dipping, and crossing each other in time with the music.

Her father almost seemed indifferent to the fact that they were dancing together. But the music sped up again and they started to travel the dance floor at a steady trotting pace. The music slowed again with them in the center of the room.

Her father leaned in and whispehred to her, "I'm glad we were given this moment to speak. I have something important to say to you."

Her father's whispered seemed to push the room's clatter and chatter away. She was focused solely on his voice, the music, and making her body move along as the music required.

The made a few more rounds before he leaned in again and said, "Avalon will not be attending the ball. And I have been told that you are not allowed to see her any more."

He twirled the princess away from him and then back towards him. She tried to master the fire in her face, but he must have seen some of it. "I know you are upset, but do try to enjoy the rest of tonight."

The music ended and the dance was over. She pulled away from her father, walking stiffly towards the ballroom entrance. People leaned in and told her how beautiful she looked and how splendid it was to see her dancing with the King.

The princess blankly smiled and nodded, consumed by what her father had just said. Had she heard him correctly, "never see Avalon again." And he said he had been told, told by who? The princess assumed she knew the answer to that question. She was sure the High Priest was behind this, though she couldn't fathom why his opinion had such sway over the king, her father.

She must have been leaning against the doorframe, looking faint. Her mother approached her and said quietly, "Are you feeling well? You look ghastly right now."

"I'm...I'm feeling overheated, that's all."

"A drawback from not wearing gowns often enough, I'm sure." Her mother replied. The princess studied her closely and saw a look of real concern in her mother's eyes that expressed something very different from her proper response to her daughter's condition. "Perhaps you should step outside and get some fresh air."

"Yes, yes, I should..." the princess replied, starting the walk briskly down the short hallway that led to the grand stairs that wound their way back down the ground.

# Chapter 3: Avalon #

She wandered outside into the crisp evening air. As she stumbled around the grounds, she grew more and more angry about what happened during the dance. She wondered if her father had chosen that exact moment in the midst of this dance, in the midst of the spectacle that he created, with all eyes on them, to deliver this news to her.

He must have known that she wouldn't take the news well, and tried to blunt the impact by staging this scene. She always assumed that her father was  too interested in the the business of being a king, or or his unusual pursuits, like cultivating flowers, to care much for crafting elaborate facades like this. She thought that he was as he appeared to be, slightly removed from daily life, the Diving King.

She tried to imagine never seeing Avalon again, and a chill rippled up through her body, causing her to skip a step and stop where she was. She wanted to start sobbing, ugly tears that her mother wouldn't approve of, but didn't. She just trembled with cold and range, stood in place, staring up at the darkening night sky.

As she stood there, she heard a faint coughing sound in the distance. She realized it was coming from the orchard and wondered if it was the boy still there working off the effects of eating so many rotten apples. Maybe he still needed help. Maybe there was something she could do to correct something, even a little thing, when everything felt off kilter and broken inside her right now.

She crept carefully towards the orchard. Thankfully, she didn't see any priests stationed around the orchard keeping watch, so she proceeded quietly towards the spot where she had last seen the boy.

In that same space in the middle of the orchard, now flooded with moonlight, she found him sitting, propping himself up agains the rocks. His head flailed from side to side and he kept his knees pressed up tight against his stomach.

She gathered up her gown around her and knelt down, carefully to do so on the opposite side of where he obviously had been throwing up earlier. She reached out a hesitant hand and rested it on his shoulder.

He didn't acknowledge her at first, so she gave his shoulder a little shake. "Are you okay?" she asked.

The boy looked at her from the corner of his eyes, and rested his head on his arms, crossed over his knees. "You shouldn't be here," was his only reply.

"It's okay. I want to be sure you're okay. I feel terrible that I didn't come find you sooner."

The boy looked up at her. His thin face seemed darker, more ghostly in the moonlight. She could hardly imagine the vibrant boy who had picniced with her just days before.

She scooted herself next to him, rested her back against the stones where he sat. The boy rested is head on her shoulder. She almost refused the gesture; it was so ingrained in her that common people, probably even priests, weren't to lay hands on her in this way. But as they sat there, she could feel the anger and angst that was gurgling inside her settle. She felt almost at peace, for a moment.

The boy started to whimper, moan, like his stomach was hurting again. He muttered out, "It's terrible. So terrible."

"I know. They shouldn't have punished you at all. I don't understand..."

The boy sat upright, his eyes wide like some kind of urgent spirit possessed him. He looked straight in her eyes, "No, not that. The rituals. What we did, what we do. As priests. I couldn't bear it. It was awful. I never want to do it again. I wish I wasn't a priest."

"Then don't be," the princess said, mustering bravery for someone else. "Leave, run away. I can gather supplies for you. You won't go hungry."

The boy stood up now, as if he was taking her advice. "No you don't understand. How can I make you see." When he said that word, he shuddered, seemed on the verge of being sick again. "I am marked down. I am a priest for life. There is no escape. Besides, I would shame my family. It wouldn't be fair to them."

Now the princess was standing too. She gripped by him the shoulders, "But how can a child, a boy bear so much? How can they ask you do that?"

The boy shrugged, "I don't know. They did though. And I'm here. And now I can't unsee what I've seen." He looked down at his hands, "Can't undo what I've done."

The princess turned away, wanting to march off and leave this frustrating conversation behind her, leave everything behind her. She took a few steps and said, "I'm so tired. I just want to see Avalon and feel better. She always makes me feel better."

"Avalon? Did you say Avalon? How do you know Avalon?" the boy said, a new urgency in his voice.

"I've...I guess I've always know her, as long as I can remember. She is my fried, my companion. She is...my everything."

"She's a monster and what she does it monstrous. And I am a part of it now. I can't believe this. I can't believe you are friends with her."

"Avalon is not a monster. That's a terrible thing to say. Take it back."

The boy stepped towards her. He was smaller than her, but tried to assert himself, "You musn't see her anymore. You don't understand how terrible it all is."

"What? Why won't anyone tell me. I don't understand."

The boy looked possessed again, "Then you've never seen the eyes. No,  you haven't. You could't have. Otherwise you would know."

"I've seen Avalon's eyes. They're grey and soft like pearls."

"Not those eyes. Not them." The boy looked over his shoulder. "Quiet, she's here. We must go."

He started to dash away. She tried to reach out for him, to catch him before he ran away in this feverish state. He must be sick and its affecting his mind, she thought. What other explanation was there for it?

The boy escaped her easily, and disappeared into the orchard and the dark tree cover. Soon, she had no sense of where he was going. But she knew he was right that someone was approaching, but must have retreated. Had Avalon overheard their conversation? What horrible things she might have heard them saying?

The princess struck out into the night to try to find the figure, hoping, wishing that it was in fact Avalon who was out walking on a night like this. It wouldn't have been unheard of for her to do such a thing.

In her wanderings, she approached the hothouse again. She went inside, thinking she had seen a figure inside, a slip of a shadow, maybe nothing more.

She paced up and down a few rows of flowers. Then she saw before her, as if appearing out of nowhere, Avalon approaching her. She moved silently and slowly towards her, seeming to walk more like an apparition than a person. She seemed to communicate so much sadness in just the way she walked.

"Princess? What are you doing out so late?" Avalon asked her.

The princess rushed forward, propelled by relief, and wrapped Avalon up in her arms. She didn't notice at first how frail and thin the body she embraced was. But Avalon seemed to falter under the pressure of her arms, the weight of the emotion surging from her.

The princess her her go and started talking quickly, "Avalon! I'm so happy to see you. They wouldn't let me see you. My father said I could never see you. And there was a boy, he turned out to be a priest..."

"Slow down, princess. We have time. Some time to catch up. But we can't talk here, it is too dangerous. Can you come to my room at the stroke of midnight?"

"Sneak out of my room?"

"Yes, it's the only way."

"I can do that," the princess replied.

"Good, perhaps this will help settle everything," was Avalon's cryptic response.

They walked back out into the gardens, then parted company at a long path lined with trees. Avalon walked down the long path until it veered out of site. Surely she had some way to creep back into the house.

The princess turned back to the house too, retracing the rounding way she got here. She went directly to her room and told her maid curtly that she wasn't feeling well when the maid tried to stop her in the long hall before her room.

***

"You looked so grown up in your gown tonight," Avalon said after they had both settled on a cushioned seat at the window. The princess could feel cold air coming in through the small gaps in the glass panes. She felt chilled at first, but shrugged it off. "I wished I had been able to see you at the ball."

The princess looked down at her nightgown, half expecting to be still wearing her fancy dress. Even now, the ball and the dancing and the fine gown seemed very far away. She almost had forgotten that she was dressed in a fine dress, forgotten that she was traipsing around outside in the folds and ribbons and ruching. She hoped that the dress wasn't ruined, but pushed the thought out of her mind.

She look up at Avalon, who was still a head taller than her, even when sitting. "I want to know everything. I want to hear everything. Where have you been? Tell me your stories."

Avalon smiled a distant, sweet smile, a vacant smile that the princess was not used to seeing. She was used to Avalon being very present, very much there before her. But tonight she seemed far away, tired. Very tired.

"Everything? I don't think we have time for everything," Avalon replied, a gently laugh dancing across her soft melodic voice. "And maybe not times for stories either."

"No stories?"

"Maybe not tonight."

"Avalon," the princess asked, her tone changed to a more hesistant one, "is everything okay."

Avalon's long fingers embraced her cheeks and she said to the princess pointedly, "Everything is as it should be."

"Then why do you seem do different. Not like yourself."

"That is what I want to talk to you about."

"I want to know everything."

"Princess, if I could tell you everything, I would. I shouldn't be telling you what I'm about to say. I shouldn't even be out right now."

"It's those priests, isn't it. Are they hurting you?"

"No, no princess. They are performing their duty. Just as I am performing mine. It's a duty that I have carried out for a long time, since you were just a baby, and now my time to carry out that duy is coming to an end."

The princess considered this piece of information, turned it around in her thoughts, "I don't understand."

"I know you don't, dear princess. I don't want you to understand. I want you to stay just I remember you. I want to remember our days together for ever."

"Please, Avalon. I'm not a child. Stop speaking to me like I'm a child. I want to understand. I deserve to understand. Everyone keeps talking about duties and ceremonys and sacred codes. Everyone seemes to be tied up in things they eithet don't understand or are too big for them to even talk about. I'm tired of it. I just want to know."

Avalon looked at her intently, "You are right, princess. You are not a child anymore. I find myself forgetting the fact. You're growing up quickly. I feel that I have missed it, that it slipped past me."

"But I'm here now."

"Yes, that is true." Avalon stopped and looked out into blank dark window. "Maybe there is time for one more story. Have I told the story of Griselda?"

"I don't think so."

"Well then, this is the story of Griselda:"

"Griselda was a woman who had lived many, many years ago in a small mountain village. She was a hearty woman and outlived her relatives, including her husband and her children. She became increasingly difficult to live with, so the villagers forced her to move further down the mountain."

"At this point, Griselda was tired of the villagers and their small complaints. So she was happy to move. She took her chickens and goats with her and found a new place to settle. In fact, she found an old tatched hut that had been adanboned. It seemed for a long time, because evertyhing needed cleaning and repairing. But Griselda had nothing but time, so she set to work."

"Many years passed and the villagers had nearly forgotten about Griselda. Some of the villager elders would recount some argument she had gotten into a local magistrate or some other exploit that confirmed for everyone, even those that could hardly remember her, that they were better off with her out of their lives."

"In those year, Griselda didn't think much time about the villagers either. Instead, she had become preoccupied with a book that she found hidden in the thatched hut, buried under the dirt floor. She happened upon it one day when she was removing old leaves and straw to place new straw on the floor."

"The book was full of strange writings and symbols. It was a book of magic. Griselda, like many of us, didn't believe in magic, but she was interested in this book. It appealed to her that, in her solitude, she should come to understand and master secret knowledge that would set her apart form others, particuarly the nasty villagers who had driven her from her home."

"Little did Griselda, or the nasty villagers know, but this was a time of war in the land. The kingdom did not exist and lords battled with each other for territory. There was terrible battles in those times. Sometimes whole villages would be burned to the ground, their inhabitant impressed into the service of the conquering lord."

"Such an army was making it way to the mountains, to Griselda's hut and her former village. She was the first to be introduced to this particular lord and his soldiers. They stormed into her hut in the night, seized her animals and the meager stores of food she kept, and continued on their way."

"In her anger, she turned to her spell book for comfort, she landed upon a spell, one that she had been studying for some time. It required casting a spell on a cloak, a very special cloak, a cloak it just do happened that she was been working on for some time.""

"She spent the rest of the night hastily finishing the cloak. In the morning, she put the cloak on and enchanted it with the spell in the book. Her work done, she followed the trail of destruction that the lord's army left. It led her to her old village."

"As she entered the village, she could not comprehend the destruction. Griselda, along with her fellow villagers, had lived an isolated and relatively peaceful life. They tithed to a lord who sent representatives to collect was was due to him, but otherwise were left alone."

"So Griselda had not seen a battlefield, and the village looked like a battlefield now. Every where she looked was death and destruction. She walked through the village, taking it all in, but not just with her eyes."

"She didn't realize it at first, but the enchanted cloak had come alive and was watching and remembering as well. For you see the cloak she had created was embroided with eyes, hundreds of eyes, looking in all directions. The cloak would grant the wearer the ability to see and remember all that crossed its path."

"Griselda finally caught up with the army, wearing her cloak, and recording incredible scenes of destruction and havoc. The eyes on the cloak were wide open, and observing everything. When the lord's army saw Griselda and her cloak, they took this to a be a bad omen, a portent of their impending destruction. The lord's army fell apart as soldiers deserted, slaves escaped, and the will to fight and destroy left them as well."

"That is the story of Griselda's cloak," Avalon concluded.

"That story seems familiar, but I'm not sure," the princess said.

"Yes, many children across the kingdom hear some version of it. You may or may not hear the name Griselda. The story's location may change. The story may not reference the cloak, but I have told it as truly as I know how."

"You've never told me that story before," the princess said. "Why?"

"I don't know. Perhaps it felt like it would reveal too much about myself. Perhaps I didn't want to tell it for that reason. Besides, you always seemed to enjoy stories about the world as it is today much more."

The princess considered this and decided it was probably true. She replid, "If this story took place so long ago, then what does this it have to do with anything?"

Avalon stood up, crossed her room and stopped before a large wardrobe. She opened the door and removed something, draping it over her arm. It was too dark to tell at first what it was. But Avalon walked back closer to her, closer to the lamp light, but she stopped several arms length away.

"It has everything to do with me, and with this. This is Griselda's cloak and I am its current wearer."

"So you are Griselda now?"

"In a manner of speaking, yes. I'm Avalon, of course, but that wasn't always my name."

"What is your name?"

"I don't recall. I remember so much. I see so much and yet I don't recall my real name. Everyone who wears this cloak is given a name. You are not the same person once you being to wear it. The things you do and see are no longer your own."

"Then who do they belong to?"

"The King. The priests. The people. All of them to some degree. So much of what we share, the stories we tell, come from the things I've seen, and others before me, have seen while wearing this cloak." Avalon paused. She studied the cloak for a moment, then returned it to the wardrobe. "But my time wearing it is coming to an end. And soon I must leave."

"Leave? Why? Where? For how long?"

"Forver, princess. I must leave forever. I have reached the point in my journey, in my time with the cloak when I must leave."

"Avalon, I don't understand."

Avalon sat again on the window seat. As she did, the princess noticed how frail Avalon seemed. Her face seemed older now, her eyes less vibrant. When she sat, she wrapped her arms around herself, as if keeping out cold, but did so gingerly, as if not resisting her own touch.

"Griselda, did not realize when she cast that spell that it contained a curse hidden inside its words, buried among the letters and sounds. When she cast that spell, she also cast the curse. And the curse she cast wasn't on own self, it was cast on the cloak and it resides in the cloak."

"So you have been cursed too?"

"Yes, from the moment I first wore the cloak, the cursed passed to me, just as it passed to all the women who wore it before me."

"Can't you reverse it? Or..." the princess's mind raced through possibilties, "if you stop wearing it now and destory it, will the curse be broken."

Avalon replied, resignation tinged in her voice, "There are stories, only known among the women who wear the cloak, stories I cannot share in great detail, of previous weaers having tried all of those things. Even unspeakable things, some of which led to the wearer taking her own life."

"That's terrible. Didn't you know this when you put the cloak on? Why didn't refuse."

"Becuase when you are asked, you don't refuse. That is how the cloak is passed down, how it always has been."

"Asked? Then you had a choice?"

"Princess, no there was a no choice. I was asked and I wore the cloak."

"Who asked you?"

"The king, of course. The wearer serves the king or queen, who rules this land. That is why I live here, housed and protected by the King. I wear the cloak because the King asked and to be asked is to not refuse."

The princess's mind was swirling with even more thoughts, suddenly her family, her story, was bound up in this terrible thing happened to the person she loved most dearly in the world. How could this be? What could she do? She got up and started towards the door, "I will wake my father up at once and demand that he release you from this bond. Demand that you be allowed to stay. Please stay, Avalon."

Avalon stood too and approached the princess, embracing her in a warm hug. The princess drew away quickly because she could tell that Avalon was wincing with pain. "You're hurt. What's wrong."

"It's the curse. I bear it with me always. It has gotten worse too."

"Let me see, I need to see," the princess replied.

Avalon hesitated, but then she shifted a sleeve from her gown down off her shoulder, revealing frail looking skin and bones, but skin covered in something, like sores or bruises. The princess stepped forward to see better. No, not bruises, eyes. Her skin was covered in eyes like those on the cloak, eyes that were blinking and moving and searching. Eyes that were remembering, even now, even in this moment, recording.

The princess recoiled, thinking of the boy and his terrified cry that Avalon was a monster. She couldn't think of her as being a monster, never could do that, but understood now how that energetic boy and had been consumed by visions of eyes.

"Your skin..." the princess said, as if just making words for their own sake.

"Yes, you understand the curse now. The cloak granted its wearer with the ability to see and rememeber. And the priests learned how to extract those stories so they could be saved and shared. But eventually the wearer would not be able to escape the impossible burden of seeing so much."

Exhauseted already, Avalon sat in a nearby chair. "At first the priests could keep the eyes from spreading, were able to harvest their visions, but the eyes grew too numerous and resistant to their rituals. And now, I can no longer bear it, I can no longer bear witness to anything more. So I must retire and disappear from this world."

"Where will you go?"

"There is an island in the sea, the tide carries the sea there. It is our retreat, our refuge when this moments occurs."

"You've been there?"

"No, but I am aware. I have seen the memories. In fact, I have experienced all of the departures. Some were pleasant memories, others I would never want to revist."

"When do you leave?"

"Tomorrow, princess. We leave for the coast in the morning. And set sail the next day. Preparations are already being made."

"And then you will be gone."

"Yes, I will fade away into the memories and stories."

"And there will be another like you?"

"Yes, that is the custom. Another like me. And then after that and it will continue on."

"Aren't you angry? Aren't you upset."

"Why, princess? I was chosen to perform a duty, a most important duty that few are called to do. I spent much of my life witnessing the more important deeds of this age, meeting the most important people. Meeting people like you, like your governess... Of course, I haven't forgotten her. But then again, I forget so little."

They both sat silently until Avalon said in a near whisper, "I'm afraid that I have used what little energy I have. I know I have shared so much with you. More than I should have. More than I was able ever to do. But I must go to bed, and you must return to your room before you are discovered. This may be our last moment together, princess. My only regret is that I will have no memories of the person you will become. I has hoped for so long that I would get to meet that person eventually."

***

When the princess awoke the next morning, her mother was in her room. Not sweeping through and making pronouncements. She was sitting on the edge of the princess' bed. The princess sat up and said in a sleepy voice, "Mother?"

"You're awake. Good."

"Why are you here?"

"I want you to get dressed. There is somewhere important you need to be."

"Where do I need to be?"

Her mother looked at her. The princess was surprised by how tired and careworn her mother's eyes seemed to be. "Avalon is leaving. She is leaving this morning. Your father told me earlier."

"I know..."

"Of course. Well, she is leaving, and I convinced your father to let you see her off. He didn't want to allow it. But I insisted." They sat in silence for a moment.

"Mother, are you crying?"

"I..I don't know, dear. I suppose I should never have let you get so attached to Avalon. Somehow it made being sequestered away in this house and this estate easier to bear. I don't know why. I knew that she would have to leave eventually."

"Do you know why?"

Her mother shook her head, "Not fully, but I have my suspicions. The priests are very secretive, and your father doesn't share much. I know that it is an honor and privilege to have Avalon in our lives. But now that time has come to an end."

The princess inched forward to her mother and laid her head on her shoulder. Her mother had always acted more like the Queen who happened to her mother, than the other way around. Her care, and this moment of affection, was unusual, seemed to come out of nowhere. But the princess welcomed it. So many things were changing, but for a moment she felt a sense of comfort and relief.

 Her mother wiped her eyes dry with a handkerchief. "I've already laid out your things. You'll be wearing sturdy boots and your heavy winter cloak. It's cold this morning. And we're traveling to the coast, where it is even colder."

Once she was dressed, the princess went downstairs to the front of the house. Outside, a three carriages were ready and waiting for thier passengers. The horses' breath rolled in clouds in the cold air.

She saw that her father and the High Priest were sitting in the first carriage. The High Priest caught her eye and nodded at her, even as he wore a look of disapproval on his face.

She was motioned to the last carriage by one of the footmen. Her mother was sitting in there already, wrapped up in a fur lined cloak.

They waited until Avalon appeared walked through the front door. Somehow she seemed even more frail in the day light. She walked slowly, with two priests behind her. A footman helped her up into the middle carriage and the priests joined them.

They traveled most of the day to reach the coast. The princess hardly took in the farms and small villages they passed through. Finally, she could see a tower standing on the shoreline and assumed that was their destination.

The tower sat on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the sea. The tower keeper and a few sailers waited for them at the base of the tower then led them down the stop steps in the cliff face to the beach.

The beach was rocky and littered with green stones. Just as her mother had said, the wind blew in bursts and gusts, whipping her cloak and dress in hollowed out shapes against her body.

Once on the beach, they headed towards a dock that had been built out in to the water. The dock was old. The wood faded gray, with green coloring in places. A small sailboat was docked there waiting for them. There was another sailor on the boat, making preparations to leave.

The princess walked at the back of the party with her mother. The party stopped well before the dock. The priests and Avalon continued on to the dock with her father and the high priests. The princess started to join them, but her mother held her back, "You must stay here, darling." Her mother said softly, so softly that the princess almost didn't hear her over the wind and crashing waves.

The priests helped Avalon on to the boat. They seemed to be reciting something and making gestures as they sat on the boat before her. Finally, Avalon sat down, keeping her out of the princess's view entirely. The High Priest nodded to the two other priests, and they sat down as well.

Two of the sailors united the boat and pushed it into the tide, before jumping on themselves. The princess saw oars appear at the sides of the boat to take them further out, clear of the tide.

She stood on the shoreline, quiet, watching Avalon be taken away. It seemed more like going in to exile than some kind of retirement. But maybe that was exactly the point. Maybe Avalon was going in to exile.

The wind continued to howl and whip at her, chaffing her skin. She tried to pull her hood more tighly over her head, but it blew off again. She watched as the ship faded into the horizon, nothing more than a small being carried on the tide, with only one way to go, to take Avalon to her final resting place.

# Chapter 4: India #

The Queen walked the line of young woman standing before her. They seemed like children to her, even though there were maybe fifteen years or so separating her from the oldest of them. These young woman represented different parts of the kingdom, different stations. Some were bareboned and hungry looking. Some wore the bored expression of someone who hasn't known hardship and difficulty.

The Queen did not know what she was looking for, what quality was she meant to detect in one of these candidates. She also found herself trying to imagine what this ceremony must have been like in the past, when her father walked the same line. What had he seen in the canddiates he choose?

One of her advisers, who had also served her father later in his life, trailed behind the queen. The old man twittered with little sounds of approval or disapproval depending on the woman. The Queen felt a pang of despair that this process was pointless.

Nevertheless, the adviser leaned towards her and whispered, "Your majesty, have you come to a decisions?"

She had not come to a decision. Perhaps she didn't want to come to a decision because she knew very well what this decision meant for her, for the candidate. Nevertheless, it was her duty to make this decision. So much depended upon it, or so the many people whispering in her ear beforehand told her.

She ignored the adviser, swept around and walked the line again. She stopped in front of one of the candidates, one of the youngest, just as the young woman was trying to furtively wipe her nose. The Queen looked at her. The young woman looked down, probably as she had been instructed to do.

"What is your name?"

"India, your highness."

"That is a pretty name. Are you not well?"

"No...yes..your majesty. I don't know. The air here is much differnet than my home."

"Yes, I suppose it is."

"Would you like to be selected, child?"

The young woman, India, was silent. The woman behind her, a mother or grandmother, nudged the girl and hissed, "Answer the queen."

"Yes, your highness."

"India, look at me." She looked at the queen. "Tell me how you really feel."

"I'm terrified your highness."

"Of me?"

India looked around the lavish room they stood in. "Of everything...but I will do my duty, queen. I diligent and will get something done when I put my mind to it."

"Good. Thank you for your honesty." The queen turned to her advisors and attendants standing opposite the line of women. "Tell the priests, this is my candidate."

The Queen turned and left the room, her advisers and attendants falling in line behind her. The senior adviser, the one who had been following her closely and whispering in her ear, hastened to catch up with her. "Your majesty, your majesty," he called after her.

The Queen stopped, closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The adviser was a nuisance she had to tolerate, just one of many things she had to tolerate in her new role. Her ascendancy to the throne had not been easy, no less because of this adviser and his scheming. But she knew he was a necessary evil; he was very connected to many of the most powerful houses.

She wanted this decision, the choice of new person to the wear the robes, to keep the kingdom's stories and memories, to be her own. Obviously this was not to be. She had to suffer the opinions of the fools around her, the remnants of her father's court.

"Yes, what is it?" she replied. She turned to the adviser, "I have made my decision. I made it clear."

"Of course your majesty, very clear. But before we forward your candidate to the priests, might I suggest that we consider all points of view."

"What are these points of view? I was given a group of young women to chose from. I chose one. Is there something lacking in my discernemnt or discretion?"

"No, not lacking. I would never imply such a thing..." The adviser's paused. "I would suggest you consider how this choice might affect other aspects of life in the kingdom."

"Such as?"

"This is an important choice. The candidate will take on a very important place in your court, in the kingdom. Perhaps there is another candidate to consider, one who might represent the interests of the kingdom better."

As the spoke, the other advisers and attednants were crowded in the hallway behind them, maintaing a respectful distance, but clearly within earshot of this debate between the monarch and her adviser. She saw them loitering over his shoulder and did not want to continue playing out this scene with an audience.

The Queen waved forth one of her attendants. As the attendnant approached, the adviser seemed to grimace in frustration. "Yes, my lady?"

"Please draw a scalding hot bath. I am in need of a soak before I attend to more of the day's business. See to it that I am disturbed."

"Yes my lady." The attendant continued down the hall, then disappeared up a flight of steps to another wing of the Queen's house.

The queen turned to the adviser, "We will continue this conversation later, in my study. Behind closed doors."

The adviser bowed his head, "As you wish your highness."

The adviser motioned forward the coterie of adviser, his lackeys and cronies, and left the Queen with hers there in the hallway.

***

After her bath, the Queen stood wrapped tightly in a dressing gown at the window in her room. The window overlooked a bustling street in the town where she had moved her residence upon her coronation. She had inwardly proclaimed to herself, "I will not be a monarch in exile." which was another way of saying that she would not be like her father.

The captain of the Queen's Guard had cautioned her against this decision, at least asked her to take up residence in the fortified tower that had been part of the old walled city. "I will not be set in stone behind thick walls," she said, nearly stomping her feet in frustration. She had learned to quell these gestures and outbursts early on. She could always see the smirks that crossed faces around her when she acted out her frustration this way.

She was not a young woman when she was crowned, but still young enough to not be considered a suitable replacement for her father. She was, after all, the first female heir to the throne in many, many generations.

Instead, she chose to situate herself in the midst of the bustling modern part of the city, the part that had swallowed up and subsumed the old walled part. This sectino of the town, already bustling and vibrant, grew dramatically once word spread about the Queen's new house. Prominent families bought blocks of houses around her. It seemed at first that she was being walled in by these influence seekers and rivals. She grew to accept this, just as she accepted many other aspects of her new life, her new identity.

She still enjoyed being able to look out and see the bustle around her, feel connected to something like the life of this place, of the kingdom. Someone on the street must have noticed her standing there, though, and a crowd began to form in the street. She watched for a moment as the people waved, pointed, wisphered, snickered, and observed her. She basked in the attention momentarily then began to feel self conscious. She waved to the people, then withdrew from the window, just as the Guardsmen began to break up the crowd.

The bell at her dressing table summoned her maids, who dressed their queen for the evening. She had duties to perform in her study, before preparing for a state dinner hosting one of those prominent families that had encroached on this neighborhood.

Once in her study, it was only a matter of minutes before a knock at the door announced her adviser's arrival.

"Yes, enter," she called out, standing to wait for him. A guard opened the door and the adviser crept into the room.

The adviser sat opposite her, but was seized by a coughing fit before he could speak. The Queen waited patiently for this to pass.

"I assume that you want to continue our conversation from before," the Queen started.

"Yes, your majesty."

"And what is your concern. Please say it plainly so that I may understand. I do not like slinking around the matter."

"Of course. I am concerned that some in the kingdom may feel slighted by this decision, your majesty."

"And why is that?"

"This child you chose..."

"India."

"Yes, India. A pretty charming name, for a pretty and charming young lady, no doubt. But she does not come from a prominent family, does not come from a prominent place."

"Then why was she put before me as a candidate."

"Well, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there are considerations there as well. We don't want the lesser houses and lesser regions of the kingdom to feel slighted either."

"So you gather up their young people for this candidacy. Make them travel far and wide, only to be snubbed their Queen. Is that my understanding?"

The adviser smiled, as if trying to smile away the ire that had crept into her voice, "Your majesty is much too ungenerous. Trust me that there are considersations like this at every turn that we must consider. So many delicate threads that must be held in tension together to maintian the fabric of our kingdom."

"You mean my kingdom?"

"Yes, of course your majesty. I only meant..."

"I know what you meant. Your meaning is plain. You think me a fool. You think me as someone to play, to wrap up in your subtle games. Have you made some promise to someone that I am not aware of? Perhaps our guests tonight?"

The adviser shifted in his seat back and forth, seeming to feign being offended, "Your majesty I would never..."

"Please do not treat me like the child you knew when my father was kind. I am not a child. I am aware of how whispers travel through these walls."

As if deciding the shift tactics, the adviser stood and said boldly, "Very well then, yes. You should, no you must select a different candidate, one that will please the lord you are hosting tonight. He is expecting a different outcome and to chose otherwise would greatly displease him."

The queen stood as well. She had not grown into a tall woman, but she held herself upright and said firmly, "At least we understand one another, then. I will consider your words and make my decision. You will be informed once I do. Please see yourself out now."

The adviser bowed and left the room, leaving the queen to pace furiously around the room.

This decision, a decision she didn't even want to make, was becoming burden to her. Perhaps she should give the adviser his victory, let him gloat to his coterie that he had won over the Queen, let the word of his influence spread wide and far. Perhaps it would embolden him to be less furtive about his schemes.

Besides, releasing the child from this burden, would that be such a terrible thing? The Queen knew the fate that was in store for this young woman, at least knew the broad outlines. She knew what had happened to her precious Avalon and still carried the grief from that moment in her life with her, even into her adulthood.

"Let them condemn their precious candidate to this fate," the Queen said out loud to herself, a childhood habit she found herself indulging more and more in her lonely life as a monarch.

***

Dinner that night began with a breach of protocol, but first flattery. "Your majesty, you look stunning tonight," the lord said upon seeing her in the receiving line.

"Thank you lord, I trust you were amenable to our negotions in advance of tonight's occassions."

"Mmm, yes, very amenable. I always find a way to make myself amenable." The lord said, with a large number of guests following behind him.

The lord she was hosting was known to have a large entourage of retainers that accompanied him in his social outings. This lord had been warned by her house managers that the Queen would not entertain this large number of guests. In the weeks before the dinner, there had been ongoing negotiations about the number of said guests. Whatever number they had arrived upon, the lord brought more. Her staff had to quickly reset the dinner service for more guests.

The dinner service met her guests approval. Many were surprised and delighted by the unusual dishes they sampled. Each one coming to highly regard the Queen's taste, assured to walk away with the opinion that their yougn Queen was entirely modern and to be respected. Or at least that was the intended effect. Her kitchen staff excelled at her jobs. She had taken care, before she resented the advice hurled at her by her advisors, to retain chefs from different parts of the kingdom, who could "meld the flavors of the land together," as one put it. Her guests tonight, though fashionable and notorious across the kingdom, were, ultimately quite parochial.

She came to this realization herself not long into dinner once she grew bored of the conversation around her. Her few attempts to engage the guests around her in various issues occuring around the kingdom, fell flat. They were able to talk about art up until a point, a topic that the Queen had lately become more interested in, but again found that the knowledge of her guests was ultimatley shallow and, frequently, devolved into gossip. Apparently, the love lives of artists was more interesting than their work.

For her part, the Queen cared little for the intricate lines that crisscrossed and interconnected these people's social lives. Even though her lack of care or concern made her feel somewhat disconnected from these people, she also felt a sense of relief that she did not to muster up any sincere feeling on the topic.

The longer these conversations went on, the more she retreated into her self, explored her own thoughts and observations. On this particular night, this almost reached the point where she could feel that she was observing herself as if she was separate from herself. She could see a Queen sitting in a crowded room of people dressed in their finery, talking, flirting, eating, drinking. And yet her consciousness was nowhere to be found in the scene. It was somewhere else entirely.

For the moment, it settled into scenes from her youth when she might have imagined situations like this. Scenes that ranged from girlish parties she might have thrown for her dolls, having loquacious grown up conversations, or at least what a child imagines grown up conversations to be like, to occassions where she was finally dismissed from the drawing room after a long night so that the adults could continue their conversations or card games.

Of course, situated somewhere in these scenes, was a ghostly faint figure of Avalon, who seemed to float across her memories of her youth like a mist. Sometimes she could scarely remember what Avalon looked like, yet could sense her presence in her memories.

After dinner, the party installed itself in the Queen's parlor, a large space that she had filled with art and musical instruments. One of the guests began strumming on a rare stringed instrument that had been given to her early on in her rule and travelled about the kingdom more. Singing soon followed. Drinks were flowing and the Queen's staff rushed to meet the demands of this voracious host the lord had let into her house.

Amidst all of the noise, she slipped out of the room and paced the main hall. To her surpise, the lord appeared beside her, he turned on his heel, seeming to scan his surroundings, really her surroundings.

"I must say, I approve. Very modern tastes, your majesty," the lord replied.

She looked at him, but said nothing. She had learned, among other lessons, that a monarch need not always reply when spoken to. This suited her disposition well, and had the added benefits of keeping her out of trouble.

"And dinner was equisite. Even I was surprised by a few of the dishes, and I am considered to be very well travel."

Again she said nothing.

"Please give my compliments to the chef and your staff. They have outdone themselves."

"Of course, I would expect nothing less of them. I will be sure that they are made aware of the compliemtn though."

"Thank you your majesty."

She started to return to the parlor, referring to abide in the din in that room than be subjected to the lord's overbearing charms.

"Ah your majesty, since we have this private moment together, I wondered if we might discuss a matter of some importance to me."

"As you wish."

"Excellent, but may I suggest that we take a seat first. I do not discussing state business while standing in such a transitory location. I find that the urge to pace or walk does not lend itself to deep, reflective conversation."

They sat in a nearby alcove on a padded bench. The queen arranged herself on the bench first, leaving as little room as she could for the lord, without being too obvious about the fact.

The lord gingerly sat on the bench's edge, seeming to not give much thought to the arrangement, or suppressing any indication that he did.

"What did you wish to discuss, now that we are sitting in a more amenable spot?" the Queen asked.

"I wished to speak about the selection of the candidate. I have been led to understand that there were some kinks in the process to work out, that perhaps the final decision had not been made. I hoped that you might avail yourself of my council to...expedite the process."

The queen studied the lord momentarily. He wasn't much older than herself, perhaps even younger. His intensity gave him a boyish quality. But there was a hunger and desire for power that undercut the appearance of youthful exuberance. He was, as he fashioned himself, fashionable, perhaps even handsome. He was a notorious bachelor, though it was rumored that he had walked away from at least one engagement. Even she knew that much from dipping her toe in the world of rumor and gossip.

"While I appreciate the guesture and offer, I will not require your assistance in the matter," she finally replied. She coudl see the lord's anger rising, his face growing stern and rigid. He was preparing to do battle with her. Her. His queen. He was going to will his choice to be her choice. It was bold and impertient. She was glad that she had already resolved to undermine this and not provide him the satisfcation of cajoling her to do his bidding. "I completely agree that the candidate your put forward should be the one advanced to the priest."

The lord looked disarmed by this unexpected reply. Perhaps he even looked disappointed. She was sure that forcing her to change her mind would have made an excellent story to share later.

***

Despite breaking many of the protocols around attending a function at the Queen's house, the guests did observe a well established rule that when the monarch announces they are retiring for the night, the party is over. As soon as she stood and made this pronouncement, the guests began bowing, making their compliments, and leaving.

When she finally made it back to her chambers, she sat relieved that the night was over, at least that part of it. She knew she had one burdensome task left before the day was truly over. She must deliver the news to the candidate she had chosen, the girl named India, that she would not be the candidate after all.

She thought about how she would broach this topic with this young woman, assuming that she would find the Queen's news confusing, perahsp even upsetting. But the Queen felt she should not delay, felt she owned the terrified, honest girl the relief she would gain from knwoing the truth.

Once she was changed, she instructed her maid to have the house manger and house mistress come to her room. When the older man and woman appeared finally, they looked upon her as if she stood in the middle of her room naked, though she was only in her night clothes. The Queen chose to ignore this and said to them, "I wish to visit one of the candidates from the selection today. Please take me there."

They both replied, "Yes your majesty" and showed her the way.

The house she occupied was very large, not as large as the house she grew up in, but large nevertheless. It wrapped around a courtyard, as well, and bridge crossed a street to connect a smaller house to it as well. Many of the house servants and staff lived in this other section. This was also where they had lodged the candidates for the few nights they needed to be available for the ceremony.

The servants quarters was quiet, but she could hear many of the servants who probably were light sleepers after so many years of service, stirring at the sound of the padding feet down the hall.

A few doors opened, followed by gasps and "Pardon me, your majesty." Some of the servants had never seen their queen up close before, much less dressed in such a casual way.

As she passed, the queen gave these shocked onlookers a downward handgesture as if to say, "carry on and don't make a fuss."

They rounded a corner, went up two flights of stairs, until they were at the top floor of the wing. The ceilings were low and the air was stuffy up here, despite one of the small round windows at the end of hall being opened to the cool night air.

They walked mid way down the hall and stopped at the door. the house manager said, "The young lady is quartered in here with her grandmother. They're probably both asleep by now, though earlier there was quiet a bit of commotion up here."

The housemistress gave the man a dispapproving look, "We had a number of upset young ladies, that is all your majesty. There was some consoling, and celebrating as well."

"That is fine," the queen replied. "Please knock and announce my presence."

The house manager did as instructed. The house mistress walked through the open door into the room and the sleepy voices that met them. The queen could hear a match strick and lantern lit. The housemistress returned to the door, "They're ready for you now, my lady."

The Queen stepped into the small room -- two simple beds pushed against either wall. A washing table between the two beds. Two traveling chests were stacked on top of each other to her right.

Much like the hallway, they had the two small window open. The coarse, simple curtains were pulled back, but the night breeze tossed them about.

The grandmother was still asleep, her back turned to the room. The young woman, India, stood in front of her bed.

The Queen tried to smile at her, to portray herself as a benificient presence, though she could tell that India was terrified. "There's no reason to be afraid, I just wanted to deliver a message to you in person."

"Yes, your majesty."

"Perhaps we should step in the hall and not wake your grandmother."

"She will not wake, she's a sound slepper. And...she's not my grandmother. Not really."

"What do you mean?"

"I was adopted. She raised me, trained me. For this moment. I've dreamed of nothing else  for many years."

The Queen was not expecting this turn, "I see. Will you sit down? I would like to sit next to you."

India tentatively stepped back to sit and the Queen approached the bed.

The house mistress tried to intervene, "We can bring your majesty chairs, if you'd be more comfortable."

"No, this is fine, thank you."

The bed sagged as she sat down, but she didn't let this distract her from her purpose.

"I wanted to tell you in person that something has changed."

"Changed, your majesty?"

"Yes, I will not be recommending you as the candidate to the priests?"

"Is it something I've done? I promise I can do better whatever it is."

The Queen reached out and took the young woman's trembling hand in her own. Her hands were soft, much like hers at this age. She's been kept from labor and work, the Queen realied. She's been held back from hardship for this moment. Again, this didn't make her task any easier.

"No, it is not because of you."  The queen paused. "Can I tell you a secret?"

"Me? Of course your highness."

"Being Queen doesn't mean you get to make all of the decision. This fact came as a great shock to me at first. I should say that I make many decisions, but some are to satisfy the wishes of others. A Queen's duty is to express the wishes and will of her people, not just her own."

"I don't understand."

"I mean to say that if I were able to, I would have recommended you. I can see that you would be a very capable candidate to wear the robe, to serve my kingdom. But I have other forces to weigh, other people to satisfy. Powerful people. So, I must chose a different candidate."

The woman looked down at her hand in the Queens hand and removed it, holding it in her lap. "I see. Is that all, your majesty."

The Queen did not mean for this conversation to go this way, she had hoped that this terried young woman would breath a sigh of relief, maybe give her an improper hug in her joy. Instead she had derailed this person from her path

She stood up, deciding it was best to leave India with her misery for now. Perhaps she could find some way to make it up to her. "No, that is all. I am very sorry for this. Thank you and good night."

The next morning, the Queen decided to take her breakfast in the solarium. Several birds had taken up residence among the lush foliage in there and she came to find their chattering comforting.

She had finished breakfast and was closing her eyes, listening to the birds, when she heard footsteps and the clank of armor and swords. She opened her eyes to see the captain of the guard, accompained by one of his guardsmen, along with the house mistress.

"Captain? This is an unexpected visit. What is it?"

They all look grief stiken, even the stoic Captain, who had lived to see many horrible things.

"I am afraid that I must deliver bad news, your majesty."

"Yes, tell me. Don't be evasive."

"There has been a terrible tragedy in the house. The young woman you met with last night, India, my lady."

"What about her?"

"She was found dead this morning."

"Dead, how? Have we tightened security?"

"This was no murder, your majesty. The young lady hung herself by her bedsheets from the rafters in her room."

The Queen closed her eyes. The birds seemed to scream now around her. Her head pounded. "What of the lady who was with her, her grandmother?"

"She has disappeared, my lady. No one saw her leave the grounds."

"Do my advisers know?"

"I cannot say for sure, but I fear that word may spread quickly."

"Be sure that it doesnt. By any means necessary. Do yo understand?"

"Yes my lady."

The housemistress stepped forward, "My lady."

"Yes?"

"I don't mean to be indelicate, but what are we to do with the body?"

"Make arrangements for the body to be cremated and bring the ashes to me. In something discrete, not ostentatious. Do you understand?"

"Yes my lady."

# Chapter 5: While My Heart Is Still Beating #

The Queen learned from several weeks later that the Priests approved the her candidate, her final candidate. Her senior advisor was delicate to the point of being ostentatious in the care he was taking to avoid mentioning the first candidate.

The fervid whipsers died down within a few days, in part because the Queen had a housemaid who had been assigned to look after the candiates' quarters was dismissed from "idle talk and gossip." After that, the house grew queit on the subject of a woman that some may or may not have rememebred was India.

The news that the priests selected her candidate came with more news from the priest, and thus from her senior adviser, who seemed very well acquiainted with the priests' ways.

"Under normal circumstances, the monarch would host the candidate's robing ceremony. The priests have made an appeal your majesty in light of the circumstances."

"What circumstances are those?" the Queen asked, not trying to be arch with her question.

"Your majesty, trust me when I saw that they are not referring to *those* circumstances. I mean, rather, that the priests are planning to have...well...a coronation of their own, as if turns out."

"I was not aware that the priests bore titles and wore crowns," the Queen replied.

"I merely meant it as a turn of phrase, your majesty. I mean to say that a new High Priest has been selected as well. You have been invited as a distinguished guests to the new High Priest's ordination ceremony as well. Becuase of this, it was proposed, I should say that I proposed that we combine the celebrations into one."

"Yes, go on."

"It would be an excellent opportunity for your majesty to venture out into the kingdom again."

"My father rarely took such trips."

"Yes, that is true, but, and I mean no disrespect, that things are very different now compared to then."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning several things. The people are very much interested in their Queen. Your appearance would brighen hears and ease minds. As you know, your majesty, there a spirit of unease and discontent growing among the people."

"I have read the reports, but you have said previously these were no cause for concern, just idle individuals indulging in fantastical expressions of violence."

"That may have been true now, but I am beginning to take a different view of teh matter, a much darker view."

"Indeed, it seems so. And you belive that I should venture out in this much darker version of the world around us. Do I understand this correctly?"

"We would need to consult with your guard and ensure your majesty would be well protected. But thing of the impact it would have, seeing the monarch's face throughout the land, on on such an auspicious occasion, two auspicious occassions no less."

The advisor was very convinced by the sound logic of his own reasoning. He seemed ready to take her place in the wagon train and wave to the noble peasants and workers, his subjects, across the kingdom.

She begrudgingly admitted to herself, however, that his plan was a sound one. It was had been several yaers since her first royal tour. Traveling again would be pleasant. In fact, her heart stirred as she thought about leaving hte confines of her house and the city for a while. The episode with India still weighed heavily on her mind. She had misread the situation so completely, which turned out to be a fatal error.

She rang a bell, causing one of the guards to open the door and a footman enter the room and bow. "Please summon the captain of the guards. I must consult with him on an urgent matter."

When the door closed, the advisor turned to her, "A delightful turn of events, your majesty."

The captain of the guard, however, had a different take on the proposal. He swept his flat hadn across his body, as if sweeping away the suggestion, cleaving it from its spot so it would topple over, "Out of the question," he replied to the advisor, once the advisor finished introducing his various provisios and considerations. The captaion turned to the queen, "Your majesty, even at the best of times, the roads leading to the priests' citadel can be dangerious. They offer very little cover, terribly visibility. They wind through small hamlets that have a long history of causing the monarch trouble."

"What kind of trouble?"

"Petty thefts, horse stealing, assassitation attempts, secession, to name a few. As I am sure you aware, I feel that a new wave of discontent will swell up in the region and overtake us."

"Would this only take one or two weeks to happen? We must depart within a week."

The advisor remained silent. The captain took a deep breath, "Your word is our law, your highness. We are the Queen's Guard, and we are bound to protect you with our lives. As guardsmen, we take this calling seriously and will gladly lay down our lives for you, but I cannot, in good faith, willingly put you in a situation where you might be required to lay down your own as well."
