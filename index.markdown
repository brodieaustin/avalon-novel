# Chapter 1 #

"Avalon!" Tara called out from her threshold between her bedroom and the upstairs hall. "Avalon!" But the footsteps that grew louder up the stairs were not Avalon's at all. They lacked the purposeful, elegeant glide that Avalon's unmistakable footsteps had. These footsteps were purposeful, for sure, but each thud announced a walker stepping with forced purpose, almost willing each step to land, one after the other.

Tara retreated back into her bedroom, slamming the door behind her. As if defying her will, the door opened again, just ajar at first, and the maid appeared there in the gap. Tara, facing the window, called out peevishly, "You're not Avalon"

"No young miss, I'm not. But I was told by Ms. Reedy to ready you for her arrival."

Tara wanted to fling herself onto the bed, to roll up in the blankets and wail and cry for Avalon until she arrived. She wanted to do something with the bundle of energy that rose up and knocked about her inside. In the past she would have let that energy knock about the room, maybe even knock into the maid. 

This very thing happened not long ago, and the maid, younger than this one, but seemingly always frail with a retiring manner, was knocked on her back and suffered a mere bump, Tara felt). The maid left their service, forcing Ms. Reedy to search yet again for a maid. Only this time, she had issued a warning to Tara. Ms. Reedy would bring this behavior to her father's attention. This surely would jeopardize her thirteenth year trip. The impatience she felt waiting for Avalon to return paled in comparison to the blistering agitation of waiting for hours and days and weeks to pass for this trip.

She simply had to control her self. So, she channeled Avalon who always seemed serene, peaceful, sometimes far away. Whereas Tara often felt herself bursting through life, Avalon seemed to float and glide. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that Tara liked Avalon being back in the household, even if these stays were inevitably too short. 

So Tara tried to imagine herself as Avalon. She stood still there in the middle of her spacious though modest room, eyes blurring out the rolling hills and trees and surrounded the house. As her feeling waned, she shut the blur out and turned to the maid. 

The door opened now and the maid filled the door's frame. This maid was more advanced in years than the previous ones. Ms. Reedy lamented that it was harder and harder to recruit good help from the capital, the capital being so far away. No wanted to venture out into the peripheray to work. Tara couldn't help but wonder if Ms. Reedy's lament was as much about herself as it was about cooks and scullery maids.

Their cottage had always been far away to Tara's recollection. When she was little and romped through the woods, this suited her just fine. Life sometimes just felt like it was her and her father. Now that she was older, and having beeing exposed to Ms. Reedy's influence for well over three years now, but she found herself coming around to Ms. Reedy's point of view. She implicity understood that the good things they lacked could be found in the capital and the bad things they had could be attributed to "this house" and "this place."

"Fine, you may proceed." Tara's finally said, resigned to the mundane things that the day held in store for her. The maid proceeded into her room and began doing those mundane things--laying out clothes, picking up others, straigthening the bed. Tidying, arranging, and moving about the room in haste.

Once the final button was buttoned, Tara sat down at the small dressing table in her room. It was one that she had had since a little girl, but still served it's purpose and so had not been replaced by a more adult version. The maid began brushing out Tara's long, thick, dark hair.

"You have lovely hair." Tara sat silently and didn't respond. "My daughter had long hair like yours. More honey color though. Yours is dark like a forest."

Tara, continuing in the theme of trying to make nice with the maid and stay in her mother's good graces, replied casually, "I didn't realize you had a daughter."

The maid stood silently for a moment, continuing to brush, as if deciding whether to elaborate further, "Yes, she was one of six. My favorite though. She was an imaginative one."

Tara's own imagination could not resist this hook and asked in a casual way, not wanting to seem overly interested in her maid's life, "What happened to her?"

Another voice cut into the room before the maid could respond, "I'm sure this is not the proper time and place for that," Ms. Reedy said, sweeping into the room with authority and assurance. The maid stepped back and curtseyed, "Ma'am."

"You may leave and continue your duties elsewhere, Frannie."

"Yes, Ms Reedy. Good day young miss," the maid replied before leaving the room.

With the door closed, Ms. Reedy stood behind her. "While I'm happy to see you getting along better with the help, Tara, you do not need to engage them in salacious conversation?"

"Salacious?"

"Frannie isn't a scandal sheet dear. I've already had to speak to her about telling tales to the kitchen help. I won't have your father's house full of talk such as that."

Tara was not entirely sure what "talk like that" might be, but she had future plans to protect and preserve and decided to not risk those by probing this evasive speech any further. She filed away this vague rule in her mind and decided that it would be best to carry out the letter and spirt of the law.

"But that is not why I came up to your room."

"No?"

"No, dear. I came to tell you that your father has granted us special permission to travel to town to purchase a new dress for you before the trip."

Tara leapt to her feet, overcome with excitement. "Really? That is wonderful." She paused, "Will it be ready in time?"

"I'm sure the local dressmaker can be convinced to work with haste for the Chief Recorder's daughter."

"Oh I hope so."

"We will leave after lunch. And after you have completed your morning studies."

Tara's excitement began to dissipate, "After lunch, but what about AValon?"

"What about Avalon?"

"What if I miss her?"

"Miss her, Tara, you must stop this silly obsessino with Avalon. It has gone on long enough. You are soon to be thirteen. Soon it will be time to declutter your mind of girlish things."

Tara shrank back from her own thoughts, feeling embarassed and ashamed of being called childish. "Yes, ma'am," was her meek reply.

"Well, then please come down to breakfast and let us start this day."

Ms. Reedy left her alone in her room to brood over her conflicting feelings. She went closer to the window and watched as the old gardener who tended what little grounds their remote cottage had. She watched as he slowly placed a ladder at a hedgerow that needed trimming. He turned back and walked with a shuffling pace to retrive the clippers that were resting against a wagon. He set the clippers by the ladder and took another trip to retrieve something else.

Watching him filled her with impatience. Why didn't he just push the cart forward and have his tools ready to use? She couldn't imagine herself plodding between these little points getting one little thing then another.

Life in the cottage had always felt remote and isolated, until Avalon returned from an expedition, swept into their lives. She swept into Tara's life, in particular, full of stories and observations about the world out there, a world that Tara hardly knew first hand.

She would know soon enough, though. She had dreamed of her first trip to the capital with her father for nearly a year now, and it was soon to happen. Then life would crack open and come spilling out. She longed to chase after it in one rush, not gingerly stepping and clipping at bit after bit like that gardener. Her life was meant for more. She would make sure it was meant for more.

***

Breakfast proceeded as it alwasy did. Her father sat absorbed in whatever reading material he had before him, vacantly forking food into his mouth, sipping from his tea cup. He finally finished, smiled and the table, and retired to his study.

Tara barely whispered a "Good day, papa," knowing that he likely wouldn't hear it anway.

Meanwhile, Ms. Reedy kept up her morning's dialog with little corrective suggestions. Their meals, particularly in the last few months, were punctuated with "Lift your chin...keep your back rigid...No, not that fork...Slurping is for the common worker..." and so on. Tara had become so used to digesting these tidbits of advice that it seems like yet mere garnish for the simple meals they ate, prepared to her father's tastes.

With breakfast done and cleared, they went to the parlor for Tara's morning lessons. Ms. Reedy focused more on the "refined" arts like languages and music. They did some drawing, though Ms. Reedy felt that Tara's drawings hewed too closely to "life as it is, not life as it should be." She would continue on in this vein, explaining "Art is best suited for elevating the mind and tastes of its viewer and listener. It should remind us that there are worlds unseen, not stay steeped in what is around us. There is no greater threat to the creative spirit than the mundane."

Tara dutifully absorbed these maxims from Ms. Reedy, knowing that they, like so much else that Ms. Reedy taught here, were all meant to prepare her for her first taste of life in the capital, for her trip, for the world at large.

Lessons went slowly today. Ms. Reedy had to continually remind Tara to focus on her studies. Tara found herself jolting to attention at any sound like might signify Avalon's return. But none of the creaks or pops or bangs that distracted here were Avalon. The promise of seeing Avalon sooner rather than later was not to be. 

Lunch time was approaching, which meant ending lessons on etiquette. Ms. Reedy began to discourse on her chosen topic today--the processional order when entering a ballroom. She seems reinvigorated as she described how to determine who in a room to give way to when the dancing was announced, and who to not defer to in the process. "Never give way to someone of a lower status. You will be announcing to the world that you have no place, or that your place is not worth asserting in the room." 

"Yes, Ms. Reedy," Tara replied. Ms. Reedy's eyes were animated by memories she must have been reliving of some scenes from her past. Tara knew that Ms. Reedy came from a prominent family. Her father had been in the Queen's entourage at court, or something like that. The result being that Ms. Reedy learned about and been exposed to many of the things that Tara was learning about and would be exposed to too.

As the lesson came to a close, Tara heard the door open and shut. Without thinking, she leapt to her feet and into the hallway to see who had enetered. "Oh, Father, it's you..."

"Tara, aren't you supposed to be attending to your studies?"

Ms. Reedy stood at the doorway now, "We were just finishing up. I'm afraid that Tara is on pins and needles today."

Her father stood staring at them both, not replying. As if finally registering the meaning of Ms. Reedy's words, "Hmm, pins and needles..."

"On account of your generous offer of a new dress."

This did little to clear her father's puzzlement, but he replied automatically, treating the conversation more like a series of scripted actions than a genuine dialog. Tara cut into the dialog, "And Avalon, father. She was suppsoed to be back by now."

"Avalon returns when Avalon returns. She has important business to attend to. You know that, Tara. I'm afraid that I must be gettign back to my work. Just took a constitutional walk to clear my mind. Please do not let me hear you ask about Avalon again, Tara. It is becoming a distraction."

Ms. Reedy interjected, "I will be sure she maintains the proper perspective adn outlook on this matter of Avalon." Before her father could leave them, she added, "Lunch will be ready shortly."

"Oh, no...no, no... I will not be at lunch today, I'm afraid. There's simply too much to be done. Simply too much." His voice trailed off as he disappeared into the house.

In the midst of their lunch, Ms. Reedy delicately wiped the corners of her mouth and said, "I was waiting to share this you and now seems like an appropraite time. I received a letter from my neice the other day."

"The younger one, who lives in the capital?" Tara, who has not interested at first in what Ms. Reedy had to share with her, snapped to attention at this. While she didn't share much of her life, Ms. Reedy had informed Tara, on multiple occasions, that her neice lived in the midst of fashionable life in the capital.

If Tara recalled correctly, the neice had married a financier, "who play such a prominent role in the kingdom these days, you know," Ms. Reedy liked to add. Ms. Reedy doled out anecdotes about her neice strategically, as object lessons in why comportment and demenour were so important to a young woman. Even though these stories about her neice were tinged with lessons, Tara still relished these stories and sometimes found herself envious of the neice. Her life seemed so much like a real life, a life worth pursuing. Perhaps even worth the pain of adhering to Ms. Reedy's instructions to obtain.

"Yes, that's the one. Her accountn of a recent party gave me several ideas for your dress. In fact, she even included a few sketches."

Ms. Reedy passed along several folded pieces of paper. The paper was very fine and thin, and so lighly perfumed. The pages felt like artifacts that belonged to someone accustomed to very fine things indeed. The sketches themselves were servicable. Tara, even at her relatively young age, could tell that drawing had not been an accomplishment that secured the neice her current status and place.

"You see that there is very little embellishment, but very rigid lines down the mid-section."

"I like the gatherings around the skirt."

"Yes, another detail worth noting. She speaks of the bright colors that are in fashion now, as well, now that new dyes have become readily available." Tara felt deflated at this news, surely it would impossible to replicate a dress colored with dyes only available in the capital. While Tara sat with her disappointment, Ms. Reedy produced a small package at the table. "She also sent along this parcel." She pushed the box towards Tara.

"For me?"

"Yes, though it is unbecoming to second guess a gift. Good manners means accepting that such gifts and tributes are due to one in the normal course of things."

"Yes, Ms. Reedy."

"But go on and open it."

Tara did just that and discovered several glass vials swaddled in course cotton cloth. She held one up to the light, looking through a brillant solution of blue tinged with a kind of shimmering iridescence. "Beautiful," Tara whispered in awe.

"We will bring these along with us today for the dressmaker to use."

***

After lunch, Tara waited with Ms. Reedy in front of the cottage for the horse and carriage to arrive. Ms. Reedy maintained a perfectly still composure, while Tara could not help but pace around the rock strewn path that circled in front of the cottage. 

She kicked at a few rocks, furtively glancing over her shoulder to see if Ms. Reedy would catch her. Fortunately, her esteeemd caretaker and governess was absorbed in a small notebook that she kept lashed to her wrist. Finally the carriage pulled up and they were rocking and bouncing down the country road that led to the small nearby town.

The town was a small colllection of buildings and houses that clung tightly to the high road that ran through it. Tara knew from her father that there once had been a mill nearby and the high road wound its way to the capital. Most local business still routed itself along these roads and this town, what was left of it in this area.

Tara spent the hour or so ride sitting quietly looking out of the carriage window. Ms. Reedy seemed to have paused her steady stream of instructions, which left Tara free with her own thoughts. Those thoughts were mere blips of images, scenes playing out at some future point. Most of them invovled the capital and the forthcoming trip. 

She realized as they traveled that at some point she would be traveling down these roads for the last time, leaving this life behind. It wouldn't be soon, but at some point. The tree lined road that gave way to rolling farmlands, fields recently harvested. Her life had been filled with scenes like these. And then one day it wouldn't be.

At last they arrived at the dressmaker's shop. The shop sold fabrics and trimmings in bulk to the households that dotted the area. The dressmaker was playing the role of shop keep at the moment, helping a farmer's wife select several bolts of fabric that would likely make clothes for her entire family. 

When the farmer's wife finished up, they negotiated the terms of the sale, which led to some portion of the purchase being made on credit. The dressmaker then turned her attention to Tara and Ms. Reedy. 

Several hours passed before the dressmaker finished the last of the pinning and sizing. It took several tries before the fabrics she drapped over Tara resembled the sketches that Ms. Reedy produced. Tara's excitement over having a new dress made quickly faded to sulky resignation as it seemed impossible that the dress being made would live up to the ideal in her mind. 

In this situation, however, Ms. Reedy's insistence that a thing be done the right way, according to her wishes, served Tara well. Ms. Reedy continued to push the dressmaker to try again and again, until what was being fitted on Tara was right. By the end, Tara left with her excitement intact and those sketchy visions of the future in her mind being a bit more filled in with detail.

Afterwards, Ms. Reedy and Tara walked the main street looking into the small shops that survived there on a mixture of necesiity, good-will, and credit. They had stopped at a curio shop that stocked with porcelain figurines, decorative bowls, prints removed from old volumes and packed into garish frames. 

Tara had stopped in front of a shelves of figurines, some brighly painted porcelain, some cast metal, of a someone that bore a faint resemblance to someone that Tara knew very well. She wasn't allowed to have these figurines in the house. Her father found them to be garish. She picked up one with bright glassy white skin with cheeks radiated a bright red glow. Tara ran her finger along the intricate patterns on the long cloak that enveloped the figure. 

Just as she was putting the figure back on the shelf a loud clanging rang out from the village tower. Tara had heard distant echoes of the clatter from their cottage when the wind blew correctly, but never up close. She stepped out into the street with Ms. Reedy who covered her ears as politely as she could. 

Tara watched as the street cleared of traffic. Everyone walked and held themselves a little more stiffly and formally than before. The lazy, relaxed air that characterized village life seemed to change at the first strike of the gong. 

She noticed that there was a voice calling out too. She had never heard a voice before, but it called out loudly, "The vigilant approaches. Here comes the vigilant. Ready yourselves for the vigilant." And repeated this way while the alarm rang out.

Looking down the street, Tara caught the first sight of the vigilant, gliding her way down the country road. Step and after careful step, she drew closer. She moved with her usual grace, but much more quickly than Tara was used to seeing. As she drew closer, Tara could see familiar features come into focus. She could make out the swirling details of the cloak that enveloped her. 

As the vigilant swept by her, Tara would see the patterns that resolved themselves to a myriad of eyes looking out in all directions, pass by her. One of the eyes fixed on her momentarily and then looked away. But the vigilant's eye did not look her way.

"Avalon!" Tara called out, "Avalon!" But Avalon, the vigilant, passed by her with no moment of recognition at all, then disappeared in the distance towards the cottage, towards her father, towards her return, her ritual return that Tara had so anxiously awaited.

# Chapter 2 #

Once Avalon passed through the center of town and was out of sight, the townspeople seemed to resume their usual activity. Their bodies started to move they way they normally moved. Conversation that had been halted, continued on. It was if someone had put the entire town under glass like a shadowbox momentarily, then lifted the glass away. 

Tara had never experienced the effect that Avalon had on people before. Certainly she had some hint of it from Avalon's stories and from what her father had told her before about the vigilant and the vigilant's role. But witnessing herself how...changed people became surprised her. 

Seeing Avalon's cloak also surpised her. She had only seen it from afar, and had never been allowed to get very near to it. Whenever Avalon spent time with her, she never wore her "traveling clothes" as she called them. Now that she had seen the cloak in person and up close, or somewhat closer, Tara had felt the same effects as the villagers. She knew the walker in a way few other people did, but when that eye trained itself on her, her body went rigid too, afraid to move, to be recorded in the midst of some act, however unknowing and unthoughtout the act might be.

Now that life had reset to its normal pace and tone, Tara's mind leapt into action. She knew that the simply must get back home. Ms. Reedy could not resist Tara's entreaties to return home for very long. Tara refused to walk the main street anymore, stubbornly refusing to so much as budge unless it was to head towards the carriage.

At last they were on their way. Ms. Reedy could not resist instructing Tara not to fidget. Finally, Tara just sat on her hands, because she could not control her restless fingers at all. The same scenery as before passed alongside the carriage, only now it seemed to progress in a painfully slow fashion. Tara desperatly wanted to bang the side of the carriage, spook the horses somehow to speed up their pace. There was no point in going to these lengths, especially since it would likely result in a prohibition against seeing Avalon at all being imposed upon her. 

Her anticipation nearly burst forth in an exasperated cry when the carriage came to a sudden halt in the midst of their journey. The stop was so quick that Tara and Ms. Reedy both nearly bounced out of their seats.

"Why are the stopping?" Tara asked.

"I do not know. Hopefully it isn't due to brigands," Ms. Reedy replied. No matter how long she lived in this remote corner of the worlds, Ms. Reedy could not let go of the idea that run into brigands would be more likely here in the middle of nowhere than a place like the capital that Tara knew from the scandal sheets, and from Avalon herself, was rife with criminals and neerdowells.

In the event that it was brigands, Ms. Reedy kept Tara inside the carraige's cabin and forbid her from peering out the window. They could hear the driver's feet thunk on the dirt road when he jumped down. A moment passed before they heard him call out, "Ms. Reedy, you had better come take a look at this..."

Ms. Reedy fussed with her gloves for a moment before replying in a raised voice, "I will be there momentarily."

Tara could tell that Ms. Reedy did not want to answer this call for help. She fussed with gloves and sleeves, arranged her hat on her head before making for the carriage door. The driver did not sound distressed to Tara, but for all she know Ms. Reedy might think this was the exact way brigands holding someone hostage would want them to sound. Ms. Reedy opened the door slowly, peering out first. She looked back at Tara, "Stay here and do not move."

Contrary to Ms. Reedy's instructions, Tara leaned out as far as she could from the door. She saw Ms. Reedy and the driver standing in the middle of road, looking down on something. Perhaps a farmer had let produce fall from a wagon. Maybe it was a dead animal. But why wouldn't the driver just clear the obstruction himself. 

Tara could see the driver shaking his head, backing away. She could just make out him saying, "I won't and can't. Not me."

Ms. Reedy replied in a stern voice, "You must. We cannot leave her here."

"No, ma'am, I resptively decline. They say those eyes can see into your soul."

"Well at this point, your soul has been sufficiently peered into. Besides, I hope, for your sake, that there isn't any darkness lurking there."

"Well being seen is one thing, but to touch her? There's strange tales of people driven to madness doing such things."

"Don't be a fool, get on with it."

The driver edged further and further back. Tara could now see what they were standing over. She dashed out of the carriage and towards the figure. She started to fall to her knees besides Avalon, but Ms. Reedy caught her in her surprisingly strong arms. 

Tara struggled against Ms. Reedy's surprising stregth, bu could only lamely call out out, "Avalon? Avalon? What's wrong? Speak to me!" She look up at Ms. Reedy, "What's wrong with, Avalon?"

"I do not know. She must be injured."

"What are we going to do?"

Ms. Reedy let go, "Stey, do not get any closer." Tara looked down at Avalon. She was curled up with her back to them. The eyes on the cloak rolled wildly in all directions, a chaotic jumble of movement in contrast to her inert form. 

Tara had never really seen Avalon dressed in her "traveling clothes" as she had called them. She had never really been allowed to see her dressed this way. She wondered if the driver  was right. What would happen if she touched her? Did Ms. Reedy believe what the driver beleived. She must have been wary enough because they were all just standing there. Tara finally cried out, "We must do something. Please, please do something!"

Ms. Reedy, who was staring at the cloak too, seemed to snap herself out of a trance. She unclipped her traveling cloak, inched towards Avalong, and threw it over Avalon's unconscious form. She turned to the driver, "Now, will you help me?"

Tara looked at him as well, tears in her eyes, "Please I beg you."

The driver took a deep breath, as if summoning up his courage, then stepped forward wordlessly to help Ms. Reedy pick up Avalon. As they moved her towards the carriage, a trickle of blood trailed behind her.

"Ms. Reedy," Tara said, "she's bleeding. Look."

"We'll put her in the carriage. Tara and I will ride in front with you Gregory."

Gregory replied in a resigned tone, "Yes, ma'am."

***

Once they arrived Ms. Reedy instructed Gregory to inform the household of what had happened. While he disappeared in the house, Tara and Ms. Reedy coaxed Avalon out of the carriage, careful to keep her wrapped up tight. Tara's father appeared at the cottage's threshold visibly distraught. Gregory was behind him. The rest of the house staff had come to the front door as well, alerted to something happenning by the general commotion. 

Once they began to realize what was happening they shrank back inside. Tara's father stepped forward and instructed Gregory to fetch the doctor from town. Her father turned to Tara and Ms. Reedy and said, "We must take her to the tower. Follow me."

Tara was surprised by her father's instructions. She had never been allowed to see the tower, much less enter it. For as long as she remembered it was forbidden. Not even Avalon would tell her much about the structure. Tara and Ms. Reedy struggled to advance a few steps with Avalon, but struggled with the burden.

Her father who was outpacing them, stopped and turned back, "Avalon, we must get you to the tower." As if sensible to his instructions, she nodded her head weakly, then shrugged off Tara and Ms. Reedy's help and began plodding her way after Tara's father. They disappeared behind a hedgerow, leaving Tara standing in the front yard, with bloodied hands, wondering what would happen to Avalon.

Ms. Reedy guided Tara inside and tried to keep her as occupied as she could. This was difficult to do. Tara found herself overcome with restless energy. She was unable to sit for more than a few minutes at a time. She paced back and forth, interrupted only by her attempts to focus on whatever task Ms. Reedy placed in front of her.

After some time passed, Tara could hear the carriage approaching down the lane and look out of her bedroom window. She could see her father waiting outside for them. His worried looked concerned Tara even more than she already had been. Finding Avalong collapsed in the middle of the road had been alarming enough, but maybe, just maybe she was overreacting. 

In all of her pacing and worrying, she realized how little she really knew about Avalon and what her long journeys entailed. She knew that Avalon would leave for long periods of time--sometimes weeks, sometimes month. Then reappear. Her reappearance would mean that her father, usually lost in his studies and work, was even less available than usual. A day or two would pass and Avalon would reintegrate herself in to their daily lives--eatign with them, taking walks, reading in the garden. 

Then she would be gone again. Being gone usually meant more stories. So, for Tara, these absenseces were well worth the wait, especially recently, when Tara relished stories about the outside world more than ever. Avalon could have recounted every minute of every expereince she had ever had or heard about and it still wouldn't have been enough for Tara. 

Finally Gregory brought the horses to a jerking halt. The doctor alighted from the carriage and met her father who led the doctor back to the tower, where he had taken Avalon, where she could not see what was happen and could only wait until something happened that she could know about.

***

The days event wore Tara down to point that she fell asleep once she sat in bed later that evening. Everything after their return home existed only as a vague blurry memory. She hardly felt like she had been present for most of it. Not that anything of consequence had happened. In fact, the remainder of the day had been spent waiting, listening, hoping for some news about Avalon. 

No news came, only that the doctor was dispatched several hours later. Her father never returned to dinner and Tara asked Ms. Reedy meekly that broth and bread be brough to her room for dinner.

Ms. Reedy was uncharacteristically gentle and accommodating towards Tara in these hours. She quietly went down to the kitchen and returned with the requested meal. They both sat in silence until she finished. At which point, Ms. Reedy announced that she would be retiring for the night. Tara nodded and sat in her window seat until the maid came to change her into her night clothes.

She fell asleep fast but it was restless sleep. Half formed visions kept her tossing and turning. At some point a sharp cracking noise sounding in the distance startled her awake. After more tossing and turning, she couldn't fall back asleep and resolved to see what the sound might be.

As she went downstairs she could hear muted voices--a man and a woman. Her heart leapt. Maybe Avalon was better and downstairs. She turned into the kitchen only to find her father and the Bettina, the cook. Her father was sitting at rustic table that served as a work surface and dining table for the small staff that ran their house.

Her father sat there, shrinking inwards at the shoulders, hovering over a fresh cup of tea. He sipped from it and noticed Tara. She would see signs of exhaustion covered his face. Normally a thin, frail looking man, her father was, nonetheless, full of mental vitality--a vitality that animated that thin face. Now the animation was gone, replaced by fatigue, maybe even sadness.

"Tara, what are you doing downstairs?"

"I had trouble sleeping , papa, and heard noises downstairs."

"Bettina is already at her morning tasks, and offered to make me a cup of tea when she saw a light on in my study."

"Would you like one, miss?" Bettina asked from her crouching position by the fire grate.

"No, thank you Bettina. I think it would make me too nervous."

The cook kindly replied, "Bless you child, we're all worked up like sharpened knives on account of our poor Avalon."

Tara's father nodded absently and sipped at his tea. He took another sip before looking at her again. A thought seemed to pass through his mind in that moment. His face was animated again, as if waking up from a stupor. "Since you are awake, let's retire to my study. I would like to talk with you."

This announcement surprised Tara. She was rarely allowed in her father's study. And what would he would he want to talk about with her? She dutifully followed her father's slouching, sliding form through the dark halls to his study. He motioned her inside towards a chair near his desk. As she sat, he pulled the heavy pocket doors closed. 

A single candle flickered on his desk, having almost burned down to the base. He brought over two other canldes from a table near the wall of book cases and lit them both from the dying one. When he sat down at his desk, his eyes reflected the quivering candle flames, seeming like two points of light about to fade out of existence.

He gave a great sigh and just say for a moment. Tara sat silently too, clutching her knees together and her hands tightly in her lap. A chill ran over her, brough about in part by the cold still air in the study. Typically there would be a hearty fire going to keep her father warm while he worked. The hearth had been scrapped clean long enough ago what was left of the fire's heat had fled the room.

At last, her father drew himself up and began to speak. He didn't speak to her, but more around her. The effect made her feel far away from him, like an audience member of a perforamnce taking place on a stage. 

"I have learned something tonight that has caused a great disturbance," he began.

"About Avalon? And her injuries," she replied in a nearly whispering tone. "Are her injuries grave ones?"

"No, the doctor says with rest and clean dressings she will recover soon enough. We are lucky in that regard."

Tara immediately felt relieved, but her father didn't seem to be. She didn't undertand why. "If it's not her injuries, then what is bothering you papa?"

"From what I can understand of Avalon's account, she was attacked."

"Attaked? By who?"

"Again, I can't say with absolute certainty, but it sounds like Avalon was attacked by members of the King's Guard."

"Why would soldiers want to attack Avalon?"

"Tara, there is much you don't know about Avalon." Her father ran his hands through his aging, thinning hair. "Perhaps I have kept you too sheltered from the world. Well, no matter, tonight is not the night to rectify such mistakes, certainly not all at once..." He trailed off in an abstract daze of thought, until he snapped back when she replied to him.

"I am not too young to understand, papa, please tell me. Knowing halves of things is worse than knowing the whole of something, no matter how bad it might be."

"That might be, but it is late, and I want to unburden my mind before it is much later."

"Then tell me, papa, I beg you."

"Avalon plays a very special role in the kingdom, and part of my job is to see that this job is performed well. If Avalon is not able to perform her duty, then I am not able to. People like Avalon..."

"Vigilants?" Tara offered.

Her father looked puzzled by the word, "Yes, this is what they're called by many common people. Vigilants are protected by the king's order. It is a grave crime to lay hands on someone like Avalon, a vigilant. Doing so put the vigilant at risk, but so much more," her father paused here, worry creeping all over his face in the shadows. "Oh, I am having trouble even saying this directly. Avalon insists that she was attacked, but not just attacked by anyone, which would be a henious act."

"Then who attacked her father?"

"Avalon insists it was members of the King's Guard."

"But if she is under the king's protection..." Tara trailed off, still struggling to put the bits and pieces of information her father was dropping into something coherent.

"Yes, exactly, then the King has rescinded his protection, and the whole project is threatened. And because of this I have come to a difficult decision. I have... I have decided to resign from my position in protest."

"Leave your position over this? Papa, are you sure? This seems so drastic, so sudden. What will happen if you do this?"

"Tara, please, I feel with my full heart and mind that this is the right course of action. If I had someway of conveying my thoughts with more haste to the king, I would do so, especially if it relieved me of this terrible burden I feel myself carrying. Since I cannot do that, I must do the next best thing."

"What is that?"

"I must travel to the capital and tender my resignation, and my protest, before the king, in person."

"In person? To the capital? But papa, we are supposed to be traveling to the captial."

"Yes, Tara, which is why I wanted to speak to you without delay, so that you would understand the importance and urgency of our traveling to the capital as soon as we are able."

"But we are already traveling to the capital, for my..." The sad look in her father's eyes helped Tara understand the implication of his decision. "Then my trip..."

"I am sorry, Tara. I know you were looking forward to this trip. I'm afraid it will have a rather different tenor now."

"But the balls and parties?"

"We will see. I cannot predict how my news will be received. I can only hope that the King understand my concern and decision come from a place of loyalty and pride and not treason."

"Treason, papa? That is a scary word."

"Indeed." He signed heavily. "We cannot predict the future with the walls of this study. Let's return to our chambers and try to gain what little sleep we can until the sun rises."

Tara stood to leave, saying goodnight to her father as she left to return to her room where she sat stunned until fatigue compelled her to sleep.

# Chapter 3 #

Resign, resign, resign. Tara repeated the word to herself over and over. It danced through her mind for some reason. She could not chase it and capture it to rid it's snake like sounds from her memory. So the word followed her throughout the day. The word was there when her father assembled the house's small staff to make his announcement. Tara watched as looks of confusion, maybe even fear crossed the staff's faces. Only Ms. Reedy remained stoic in the face of the news.

Not long afterwards, she knocked on Tara's door and entered solemnly. Tara looked up from her book and merely said, "Ms. Reedy."

She replied with a curt "Tara."

"Is something wrong? You never gave me any lessons, so I decided to read instead." Ms. Reedy did not move and speak. So Tara added, "Ms. Reedy you are worrying me. Please say something."

Ms. Reedy started to speak in a halting way, "I have spoken with your father and have submitted by resignation to him. I will be leaving later this afternoon."

Resigned, there was that word again. Like an imp, it played and preyed on her feelings. She wished she would never hear that word again. Tara surprised herself, and certainly Ms. Reedy, by launching herself towards Ms. Reedy and embracing her in a tearful hug.

Ms. Reedy stiffened and nervously patted her head. Tara did not think she had ever hugged Ms. Reedy before. She cheek pressed against the bone stays in Ms. Reedy's dress and her arms coiled around the folds of her dress. Had she been asked, she probably could not even fully explain why she hugged Ms. Reedy, but the impulse to do it overwhelmed her.

Finally, Ms. Reedy pulled her away and rearranged her dress. She wiped a suggestion of a tear away from the corner of her eye. True to herself and her maxims, through, Ms. Reedy maintained her composure and did not let emotion rule over this moment.

"I have left instructions with the staff to help with the final preparations for your trip."

"Where will you go, Ms. Reedy?"

"I will travel north where I have a brother who is a magistrate. From there, who can say? But I feel that my time here has come to and end."

"And what about me?"

"I do not know, Tara. That is the most honest answer I can give you. I wish I knew, but now your path is unclear. You must take what I have taught you and try your best to navigate life's currents."

"I wish I understood why papa is doing this. Do you think it is right?"

"Right? That is not for me to say. Your father holds a very esteemed position in the kingdom and has served the kingdom loyally. He feels that there has been an affront to his reputation and must take this action. The decision will not be without consequence, I'm afraid. But fearing consequences shouldn't determine our sense of right and wrong."

Tara felt serious all of a sudden and considered what Ms. Reedy said. She nodded her head, "I feel that to be true."

"Then my work here is complete.
