<!-- # Backstory #

To have asked how long the vigilants had been in the world, would have been like asking how long there had been mountains and streams and tress. For as long as anyone could remember, there had been vigilants.

The number changed from telling to telling, and over the many many years the numbers had changed due to disease and wars, those two blades that seemed to sharpen to a fine point over and over again to cut through life. Four. Five, sometimes six.

No one knew exactly where they came from, but there were stories. Some stories held that when the veil between this world and some other world was thin and permeable. The idea of such a veil and such a passing seemed plausable enough to most people. The belief in such things had been stronger in days long passed. It used to be the case that little accidents or little unexplained occurences would be attributed to the fact that nothing was truly permanent in this world and that beings could pass back and forth. Whether these beings were in the world for good or ill depended up on the story and the teller. 

But some reason the vigilants had stayed and gave their most unique possession to this world as a gift--the cloaks with eyes that could see all and remember all.

Perhaps the most widly repeated and most commonly believed origin story went something like this. In some obscure corner of the world, there was minor landholder whose inheritance was nothing much more than a crumbling manor house and arid lands. But this landholder was ambitious and ruthless. He also had a knack for raising large armies to supply the king. These armies were not just fodder for the battlefield. He somehow imbued his armies with the same ruthlessness that he posessed. They brough death and desctrution to any enemy they met on the battlefield. Because of his and his solders' prowess, this landholder became a lord, then held a seat on the king's council, which meant moving to the court and insinutating himself into palace life. 

It was at the palace that he made an unlikely alliance. At the time fortune tellers, seers, soothsayers, and the like were in great demand. All around the capital there seemed to be shops and stalls where one could have their futures or pasts divined. 

The lord, as it turned out, enjoyed visiting these prognosticators. In particular, he found one who seemed to be in touch with very powerful forces and could read the stirrings of the Lord's heart with surprising accuracy. The lord invited this seer into his household and cultivated him as a kind of advisor. He brought him with him on campaigns and consulted him about his prospect on the battlefield.

With the seers help, it seemed that the lord was invincible and his stature grew even greater in the kingdom. In fact, the king came to look on him as a kind of adopted son. Since the king had no heir, it was widely assumed that the lord would assume the throne when the king passed on from this world. An obscure branch of the royal family learned of these whispered plans and moved to seize power for themselves. 

Ten years of costly wars ensued, but with the lord leading the king's armies, they had managed to route the family's forces. That is until one battle. The lord felt that the conditions were not right for a battle, they found themselves downhill from the enemy forces, separated by a lazy creek. A dense morning fog had rolled in and obscurbed everything a few few away. The lord's forces were arranged for battle. Horses stamped at the ground; arches knocked their first array and kept their bow string at the ready.

They did not move without the lord's command. The enemy merely waited in its superior position. The lord consulted with the seer to determine whether or not the time was propitious for a battle. The seer consulted cards and bones and meditated on the question. Each time the answer came back as a resounding yes. Victory was guaranteed if the lord moved swiftly. 

The time, as it turned out, was not propitious for the lord. The king's family routed the king's forces, breaking the back of his most powerful host. The losses were staggering. The lord's men, men he had led into battle for years now, lay mangled on the battlefield with hideous wounds. Fires had been set which mingled with the fog causing men and animals to suffocate in the smoke. Everywhere the lord looked were reminders of how crushign this defeat had been.

He returned to the camp and ordered two men to seize the seer. They rode with unimaginable haste back to the king and the court. Word had reached the king that his forces had been defeated in a great battle. The lord sought an audience with the king. At first he was denied. The king's advisors urged him to arrest the lord and execute him. The king was old now and tired of the particulars of running a kingdom, but he enjoyed his comfort and ease and did not relish relinquishing the throne. He reluctantly agreed to see the lord who insisted he had a plan to avoid such defeats in the future. The king listened to the plan and agreed to it.

The king issued a proclomation and the lord set to work immediately. Throughout the kingdom, all of the seers and prophers and fortunte tellers were rounded by the king's soldiers, including the lord's favored seer. They were brought to the palace. The lord assembled them together and told them about his proposed plan. He demanded to know if anyone could make this happen. One seer, a young woman raised her hand and said that she could.

The other seers in the room tried to turn on her immedidately, terrified by what was about to happen to them. The soldiers stopped them and jailed each one. After this, one by one, the lord saw to it that each seer's eyes were removed. They were collected and given to the woman who had volunteered to perform the the task She was given cloaks and stitched the seers' eyes to the cloaks--maybe give, maybe six in total.

At first the king and his retinue recoiled in horror when the young woman entered the king's hall wearing the first cloak she had constructed. The eyes all moved about wildly, out of control, as if bewildered by their current situation. All of the eyes of the seers who had looked the past, present and future, were trained to one goal, to record and observe so that the lord would never be surprised again.

How she would accomplish such a task was never fully explained, but it was generally understood that people in past times were capable of things that were not possible now. Some whispered that such things were not allowed and that the king had forbade such arts to be practiced. One thing that did remain constant though, was that only women were allowed to wear the cloaks, partly as a remembereance of the yougn woman who had constructed the cloak but also as a mark against the man who the lord felt had betrayed him.

[is this resuable?]
While surveying the damage, the lord noticed a figure standing on the horizon line, looking over the battlefield. He asked several of his lieutenants who that was. They did not know. It took a nearby footsoldier overhearing to say, "My lord, there were rumors running everywhere about one of them vigilants passing through the battle. I swear I seen her standing right near me as I was strangling an enemy to his death."

The figure continued to stand on one place, watching over them, the wind whisking the edges of the mystical cloak around the immoveable form. The lord turned to his lieutenants and said, "Bring my that vigilant."

Later that evening when the host was encamped and engulfed in the sounds of crackinling fires, singing, and clanking glasses, the lord was resting in his own tent consulting with his seer when he heard a commotion run through the camp. He roused himself up to see what was happening. Solders were running from something. Yet there was no shouts from the guard, no alarms being raised. 

The seer stood beside him at the tent's entrance. The lord looked to him and said, "What is the meaning of this?"

The seer is said to have replied, "The vigilant approaches."

This phrase came to be commonly used when, in fact, a vigilant approahced. The way people said it tended to have a tone of dire warning, foreboding, anxiety. Much like the solders fleeing the camp, it has long been customary to want to avoid the glare of the vigialtn's eyes, to not be captured by one of those roaming eyes. It was also said that staring into one of the eyes could lead you to madness. Or so the stories went.

The lord tried to step into the breach and stop his men from leaving, but it did little good. They were resolved to flee and he was resolved not to flee. The vigialng finally came into view, escorted by two solders who seemed to have almost reached the limit of their sanity. As soon as the vigilant stopped before the lord and seer, the soldiers broke ranks and ran as well.

The story paints a very vivid picture of the vigilant standing before the lord and seer in the dim light of the camp fires, saying nothing, merely staring at the lord, while the eyes on the cloak roamed in all directions looking for something to train their gaze on and watch.

The lord is said to have stepped forward and began a formal speech, praising the vigilant, explaining how he could make use of her talents. Whether or not the lord gave such a speech is difficult to say for sure, but it so it was recorded and so it has been shared, told and retold. -->

# Chapter 1 #

"Avalon!" Tara called out from her threshold between her bedroom and the upstairs hall. "Avalon!" But the footsteps that grew louder up the stairs were not Avalon's at all. They lacked the purposeful, elegeant glide that Avalon's unmistakable footsteps had. These footsteps were purposeful, for sure, but each thud announced a walker stepping with forced purpose, almost willing each step to land, one after the other.

Tara retreated back into her bedroom, slamming the door behind her. As if defying her will, the door opened again, just ajar at first, and the maid appeared there in the gap. Tara, facing the window, called out peevishly, "You're not Avalon"

"No young miss, I'm not. But I was told by Ms. Reedy to ready you for her arrival."

Tara wanted to fling herself onto the bed, to roll up in the blankets and wail and cry for Avalon until she arrived. She wanted to do something with the bundle of energy that rose up and knocked about her inside. In the past she would have let that energy knock about the room, maybe even knock into the maid. 

This very thing happened not long ago, and the maid, younger than this one, but seemingly always frail with a retiring manner, was knocked on her back and suffered a mere bump, Tara felt). The maid left their service, forcing Ms. Reedy to search yet again for a maid. Only this time, she had issued a warning to Tara. Ms. Reedy would bring this behavior to her father's attention. This surely would jeopardize her fifteenth year trip. The impatience she felt waiting for Avalon to return paled in comparison to the blistering agitation of waiting for hours and days and weeks to pass for this trip.

She simply had to control her self. So, she channeled Avalon who always seemed serene, peaceful, sometimes far away. Whereas Tara often felt herself bursting through life, Avalon seemed to float and glide. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that Tara liked Avalon being back in the household, even if these stays were inevitably too short. 

So Tara tried to imagine herself as Avalon. She stood still there in the middle of her spacious though modest room, eyes blurring out the rolling hills and trees and surrounded the house. As her feeling waned, she shut the blur out and turned to the maid. 

The door opened now and the maid filled the door's frame. This maid was more advanced in years than the previous ones. Ms. Reedy lamented that it was harder and harder to recruit good help from the capital, the capital being so far away. No wanted to venture out into the peripheray to work. Tara couldn't help but wonder if Ms. Reedy's lament was as much about herself as it was about cooks and scullery maids.

Their cottage had always been far away to Tara's recollection. When she was little and romped through the woods, this suited her just fine. Life sometimes just felt like it was her and her father. Now that she was older, and having beeing exposed to Ms. Reedy's influence for well over three years now, but she found herself coming around to Ms. Reedy's point of view. She implicity understood that the good things they lacked could be found in the capital and the bad things they had could be attributed to "this house" and "this place."

"Fine, you may proceed." Tara's finally said, resigned to the mundane things that the day held in store for her. The maid proceeded into her room and began doing those mundane things--laying out clothes, picking up others, straigthening the bed. Tidying, arranging, and moving about the room in haste.

Once the final button was buttoned, Tara sat down at the small dressing table in her room. It was one that she had had since a little girl, but still served it's purpose and so had not been replaced by a more adult version. The maid began brushing out Tara's long, thick, dark hair.

"You have lovely hair." Tara sat silently and didn't respond. "My daughter had long hair like yours. More honey color though. Yours is dark like a forest."

Tara, continuing in the theme of trying to make nice with the maid and stay in her mother's good graces, replied casually, "I didn't realize you had a daughter."

The maid stood silently for a moment, continuing to brush, as if deciding whether to elaborate further, "Yes, she was one of six. My favorite though. She was an imaginative one."

Tara's own imagination could not resist this hook and asked in a casual way, not wanting to seem overly interested in her maid's life, "What happened to her?"

Another voice cut into the room before the maid could respond, "I'm sure this is not the proper time and place for that," Ms. Reedy said, sweeping into the room with authority and assurance. The maid stepped back and curtseyed, "Ma'am."

"You may leave and continue your duties elsewhere, Frannie."

"Yes, Ms Reedy. Good day young miss," the maid replied before leaving the room.

With the door closed, Ms. Reedy stood behind her. "While I'm happy to see you getting along better with the help, Tara, you do not need to engage them in salacious conversation?"

"Salacious?"

"Frannie isn't a scandal sheet dear. I've already had to speak to her about telling tales to the kitchen help. I won't have your father's house full of talk such as that."

Tara was not entirely sure what "talk like that" might be, but she had future plans to protect and preserve and decided to not risk those by probing this evasive speech any further. She filed away this vague rule in her mind and decided that it would be best to carry out the letter and spirt of the law.

"But that is not why I came up to your room."

"No?"

"No, dear. I came to tell you that your father has granted us special permission to travel to town to purchase a new dress for you before the trip."

Tara leapt to her feet, overcome with excitement. "Really? That is wonderful." She paused, "Will it be ready in time?"

"I'm sure the local dressmaker can be convinced to work with haste for the Chief Recorder's daughter."

"Oh I hope so."

"We will leave after lunch. And after you have completed your morning studies."

Tara's excitement began to dissipate, "After lunch, but what about AValon?"

"What about Avalon?"

"What if I miss her?"

"Miss her, Tara, you must stop this silly obsessino with Avalon. It has gone on long enough. You are soon to be fifteen. Soon it will be time to declutter your mind of girlish things."

Tara shrank back from her own thoughts, feeling embarassed and ashamed of being called childish. "Yes, ma'am," was her meek reply.

"Well, then please come down to breakfast and let us start this day."

Ms. Reedy left her alone in her room to brood over her conflicting feelings. She went closer to the window and watched as the old gardener who tended what little grounds their remote cottage had. She watched as he slowly placed a ladder at a hedgerow that needed trimming. He turned back and walked with a shuffling pace to retrive the clippers that were resting against a wagon. He set the clippers by the ladder and took another trip to retrieve something else.

Watching him filled her with impatience. Why didn't he just push the cart forward and have his tools ready to use? She couldn't imagine herself plodding between these little points getting one little thing then another.

Life in the cottage had always felt remote and isolated, until Avalon returned from an expedition, swept into their lives. She swept into Tara's life, in particular, full of stories and observations about the world out there, a world that Tara hardly knew first hand.

She would know soon enough, though. She had dreamed of her first trip to the capital with her father for nearly a year now, and it was soon to happen. Then life would crack open and come spilling out. She longed to chase after it in one rush, not gingerly stepping and clipping at bit after bit like that gardener. Her life was meant for more. She would make sure it was meant for more.

***

Breakfast proceeded as it alwasy did. Her father sat absorbed in whatever reading material he had before him, vacantly forking food into his mouth, sipping from his tea cup. He finally finished, smiled and the table, and retired to his study.

Tara barely whispered a "Good day, papa," knowing that he likely wouldn't hear it anway.

Meanwhile, Ms. Reedy kept up her morning's dialog with little corrective suggestions. Their meals, particularly in the last few months, were punctuated with "Lift your chin...keep your back rigid...No, not that fork...Slurping is for the common worker..." and so on. Tara had become so used to digesting these tidbits of advice that it seems like yet mere garnish for the simple meals they ate, prepared to her father's tastes.

With breakfast done and cleared, they went to the parlor for Tara's morning lessons. Ms. Reedy focused more on the "refined" arts like languages and music. They did some drawing, though Ms. Reedy felt that Tara's drawings hewed too closely to "life as it is, not life as it should be." She would continue on in this vein, explaining "Art is best suited for elevating the mind and tastes of its viewer and listener. It should remind us that there are worlds unseen, not stay steeped in what is around us. There is no greater threat to the creative spirit than the mundane."

Tara dutifully absorbed these maxims from Ms. Reedy, knowing that they, like so much else that Ms. Reedy taught here, were all meant to prepare her for her first taste of life in the capital, for her trip, for the world at large.

Lessons went slowly today. Ms. Reedy had to continually remind Tara to focus on her studies. Tara found herself jolting to attention at any sound like might signify Avalon's return. But none of the creaks or pops or bangs that distracted here were Avalon. The promise of seeing Avalon sooner rather than later was not to be. 

Lunch time was approaching, which meant ending lessons on etiquette. Ms. Reedy began to discourse on her chosen topic today--the processional order when entering a ballroom. She seems reinvigorated as she described how to determine who in a room to give way to when the dancing was announced, and who to not defer to in the process. "Never give way to someone of a lower status. You will be announcing to the world that you have no place, or that your place is not worth asserting in the room." 

"Yes, Ms. Reedy," Tara replied. Ms. Reedy's eyes were animated by memories she must have been reliving of some scenes from her past. Tara knew that Ms. Reedy came from a prominent family. Her father had been in the Queen's entourage at court, or something like that. The result being that Ms. Reedy learned about and been exposed to many of the things that Tara was learning about and would be exposed to too.

As the lesson came to a close, Tara heard the door open and shut. Without thinking, she leapt to her feet and into the hallway to see who had enetered. "Oh, Father, it's you..."

"Tara, aren't you supposed to be attending to your studies?"

Ms. Reedy stood at the doorway now, "We were just finishing up. I'm afraid that Tara is on pins and needles today."

Her father stood staring at them both, not replying. As if finally registering the meaning of Ms. Reedy's words, "Hmm, pins and needles..."

"On account of your generous offer of a new dress."

This did little to clear her father's puzzlement, but he replied automatically, treating the conversation more like a series of scripted actions than a genuine dialog. Tara cut into the dialog, "And Avalon, father. She was suppsoed to be back by now."

"Avalon returns when Avalon returns. She has important business to attend to. You know that, Tara. I'm afraid that I must be gettign back to my work. Just took a constitutional walk to clear my mind. Please do not let me hear you ask about Avalon again, Tara. It is becoming a distraction."

Ms. Reedy interjected, "I will be sure she maintains the proper perspective adn outlook on this matter of Avalon." Before her father could leave them, she added, "Lunch will be ready shortly."

"Oh, no...no, no... I will not be at lunch today, I'm afraid. There's simply too much to be done. Simply too much." His voice trailed off as he disappeared into the house.

In the midst of their lunch, Ms. Reedy delicately wiped the corners of her mouth and said, "I was waiting to share this you and now seems like an appropraite time. I received a letter from my neice the other day."

"The younger one, who lives in the capital?" Tara, who has not interested at first in what Ms. Reedy had to share with her, snapped to attention at this. While she didn't share much of her life, Ms. Reedy had informed Tara, on multiple occasions, that her neice lived in the midst of fashionable life in the capital.

If Tara recalled correctly, the neice had married a financier, "who play such a prominent role in the kingdom these days, you know," Ms. Reedy liked to add. Ms. Reedy doled out anecdotes about her neice strategically, as object lessons in why comportment and demenour were so important to a young woman. Even though these stories about her neice were tinged with lessons, Tara still relished these stories and sometimes found herself envious of the neice. Her life seemed so much like a real life, a life worth pursuing. Perhaps even worth the pain of adhering to Ms. Reedy's instructions to obtain.

"Yes, that's the one. Her accountn of a recent party gave me several ideas for your dress. In fact, she even included a few sketches."

Ms. Reedy passed along several folded pieces of paper. The paper was very fine and thin, and so lighly perfumed. The pages felt like artifacts that belonged to someone accustomed to very fine things indeed. The sketches themselves were servicable. Tara, even at her relatively young age, could tell that drawing had not been an accomplishment that secured the neice her current status and place.

"You see that there is very little embellishment, but very rigid lines down the mid-section."

"I like the gatherings around the skirt."

"Yes, another detail worth noting. She speaks of the bright colors that are in fashion now, as well, now that new dyes have become readily available." Tara felt deflated at this news, surely it would impossible to replicate a dress colored with dyes only available in the capital. While Tara sat with her disappointment, Ms. Reedy produced a small package at the table. "She also sent along this parcel." She pushed the box towards Tara.

"For me?"

"Yes, though it is unbecoming to second guess a gift. Good manners means accepting that such gifts and tributes are due to one in the normal course of things."

"Yes, Ms. Reedy."

"But go on and open it."

Tara did just that and discovered several glass vials swaddled in course cotton cloth. She held one up to the light, looking through a brillant solution of blue tinged with a kind of shimmering iridescence. "Beautiful," Tara whispered in awe.

"We will bring these along with us today for the dressmaker to use."

***

After lunch, Tara waited with Ms. Reedy in front of the cottage for the horse and carriage to arrive. Ms. Reedy maintained a perfectly still composure, while Tara could not help but pace around the rock strewn path that circled in front of the cottage. 

She kicked at a few rocks, furtively glancing over her shoulder to see if Ms. Reedy would catch her. Fortunately, her esteeemd caretaker and governess was absorbed in a small notebook that she kept lashed to her wrist. Finally the carriage pulled up and they were rocking and bouncing down the country road that led to the small nearby town.

The town was a small colllection of buildings and houses that clung tightly to the high road that ran through it. Tara knew from her father that there once had been a mill nearby and the high road wound its way to the capital. Most local business still routed itself along these roads and this town, what was left of it in this area.

Tara spent the hour or so ride sitting quietly looking out of the carriage window. Ms. Reedy seemed to have paused her steady stream of instructions, which left Tara free with her own thoughts. Those thoughts were mere blips of images, scenes playing out at some future point. Most of them invovled the capital and the forthcoming trip. 

She realized as they traveled that at some point she would be traveling down these roads for the last time, leaving this life behind. It wouldn't be soon, but at some point. The tree lined road that gave way to rolling farmlands, fields recently harvested. Her life had been filled with scenes like these. And then one day it wouldn't be.

At last they arrived at the dressmaker's shop. The shop sold fabrics and trimmings in bulk to the households that dotted the area. The dressmaker was playing the role of shop keep at the moment, helping a farmer's wife select several bolts of fabric that would likely make clothes for her entire family. 

When the farmer's wife finished up, they negotiated the terms of the sale, which led to some portion of the purchase being made on credit. The dressmaker then turned her attention to Tara and Ms. Reedy. 

Several hours passed before the dressmaker finished the last of the pinning and sizing. It took several tries before the fabrics she drapped over Tara resembled the sketches that Ms. Reedy produced. Tara's excitement over having a new dress made quickly faded to sulky resignation as it seemed impossible that the dress being made would live up to the ideal in her mind. 

In this situation, however, Ms. Reedy's insistence that a thing be done the right way, according to her wishes, served Tara well. Ms. Reedy continued to push the dressmaker to try again and again, until what was being fitted on Tara was right. By the end, Tara left with her excitement intact and those sketchy visions of the future in her mind being a bit more filled in with detail.

Afterwards, Ms. Reedy and Tara walked the main street looking into the small shops that survived there on a mixture of necesiity, good-will, and credit. They had stopped at a curio shop that stocked with porcelain figurines, decorative bowls, prints removed from old volumes and packed into garish frames. 

Tara had stopped in front of a shelves of figurines, some brighly painted porcelain, some cast metal, of a someone that bore a faint resemblance to someone that Tara knew very well. She wasn't allowed to have these figurines in the house. Her father found them to be garish. She picked up one with bright glassy white skin with cheeks radiated a bright red glow. Tara ran her finger along the intricate patterns on the long cloak that enveloped the figure. 

Just as she was putting the figure back on the shelf a loud clanging rang out from the village tower. Tara had heard distant echoes of the clatter from their cottage when the wind blew correctly, but never up close. She stepped out into the street with Ms. Reedy who covered her ears as politely as she could. 

Tara watched as the street cleared of traffic. Everyone walked and held themselves a little more stiffly and formally than before. The lazy, relaxed air that characterized village life seemed to change at the first strike of the gong. 

She noticed that there was a voice calling out too. She had never heard a voice before, but it called out loudly, "The vigilant approaches. Here comes the vigilant. Ready yourselves for the vigilant." And repeated this way while the alarm rang out.

Looking down the street, Tara caught the first sight of the vigilant, gliding her way down the country road. Step and after careful step, she drew closer. She moved with her usual grace, but much more quickly than Tara was used to seeing. As she drew closer, Tara could see familiar features come into focus. She could make out the swirling details of the cloak that enveloped her. 

As the vigilant swept by her, Tara would see the patterns that resolved themselves to a myriad of eyes looking out in all directions, pass by her. One of the eyes fixed on her momentarily and then looked away. But the vigilant's eye did not look her way.

"Avalon!" Tara called out, "Avalon!" But Avalon, the vigilant, passed by her with no moment of recognition at all, then disappeared in the distance towards the cottage, towards her father, towards her return, her ritual return that Tara had so anxiously awaited.

# Chapter 2 #

Once Avalon passed through the center of town and was out of sight, the townspeople seemed to resume their usual activity. Their bodies started to move they way they normally moved. Conversation that had been halted, continued on. It was if someone had put the entire town under glass like a shadowbox momentarily, then lifted the glass away. 

Tara had never experienced the effect that Avalon had on people before. Certainly she had some hint of it from Avalon's stories and from what her father had told her before about the vigilant and the vigilant's role. But witnessing herself how...changed people became surprised her. 

Seeing Avalon's cloak also surpised her. She had only seen it from afar, and had never been allowed to get very near to it. Whenever Avalon spent time with her, she never wore her "traveling clothes" as she called them. Now that she had seen the cloak in person and up close, or somewhat closer, Tara had felt the same effects as the villagers. She knew the walker in a way few other people did, but when that eye trained itself on her, her body went rigid too, afraid to move, to be recorded in the midst of some act, however unknowing and unthoughtout the act might be.

Now that life had reset to its normal pace and tone, Tara's mind leapt into action. She knew that the simply must get back home. Ms. Reedy could not resist Tara's entreaties to return home for very long. Tara refused to walk the main street anymore, stubbornly refusing to so much as budge unless it was to head towards the carriage.

At last they were on their way. Ms. Reedy could not resist instructing Tara not to fidget. Finally, Tara just sat on her hands, because she could not control her restless fingers at all. The same scenery as before passed alongside the carriage, only now it seemed to progress in a painfully slow fashion. Tara desperatly wanted to bang the side of the carriage, spook the horses somehow to speed up their pace. There was no point in going to these lengths, especially since it would likely result in a prohibition against seeing Avalon at all being imposed upon her. 

Her anticipation nearly burst forth in an exasperated cry when the carriage came to a sudden halt in the midst of their journey. The stop was so quick that Tara and Ms. Reedy both nearly bounced out of their seats.

"Why are the stopping?" Tara asked.

"I do not know. Hopefully it isn't due to brigands," Ms. Reedy replied. No matter how long she lived in this remote corner of the worlds, Ms. Reedy could not let go of the idea that run into brigands would be more likely here in the middle of nowhere than a place like the capital that Tara knew from the scandal sheets, and from Avalon herself, was rife with criminals and neerdowells.

In the event that it was brigands, Ms. Reedy kept Tara inside the carraige's cabin and forbid her from peering out the window. They could hear the driver's feet thunk on the dirt road when he jumped down. A moment passed before they heard him call out, "Ms. Reedy, you had better come take a look at this..."

Ms. Reedy fussed with her gloves for a moment before replying in a raised voice, "I will be there momentarily."

Tara could tell that Ms. Reedy did not want to answer this call for help. She fussed with gloves and sleeves, arranged her hat on her head before making for the carriage door. The driver did not sound distressed to Tara, but for all she know Ms. Reedy might think this was the exact way brigands holding someone hostage would want them to sound. Ms. Reedy opened the door slowly, peering out first. She looked back at Tara, "Stay here and do not move."

Contrary to Ms. Reedy's instructions, Tara leaned out as far as she could from the door. She saw Ms. Reedy and the driver standing in the middle of road, looking down on something. Perhaps a farmer had let produce fall from a wagon. Maybe it was a dead animal. But why wouldn't the driver just clear the obstruction himself. 

Tara could see the driver shaking his head, backing away. She could just make out him saying, "I won't and can't. Not me."

Ms. Reedy replied in a stern voice, "You must. We cannot leave her here."

"No, ma'am, I resptively decline. They say those eyes can see into your soul."

"Well at this point, your soul has been sufficiently peered into. Besides, I hope, for your sake, that there isn't any darkness lurking there."

"Well being seen is one thing, but to touch her? There's strange tales of people driven to madness doing such things."

"Don't be a fool, get on with it."

The driver edged further and further back. Tara could now see what they were standing over. She dashed out of the carriage and towards the figure. She started to fall to her knees besides Avalon, but Ms. Reedy caught her in her surprisingly strong arms. 

Tara struggled against Ms. Reedy's surprising stregth, bu could only lamely call out out, "Avalon? Avalon? What's wrong? Speak to me!" She look up at Ms. Reedy, "What's wrong with, Avalon?"

"I do not know. She must be injured."

"What are we going to do?"

Ms. Reedy let go, "Stey, do not get any closer." Tara looked down at Avalon. She was curled up with her back to them. The eyes on the cloak rolled wildly in all directions, a chaotic jumble of movement in contrast to her inert form. 

Tara had never really seen Avalon dressed in her "traveling clothes" as she had called them. She had never really been allowed to see her dressed this way. She wondered if the driver  was right. What would happen if she touched her? Did Ms. Reedy believe what the driver beleived. She must have been wary enough because they were all just standing there. Tara finally cried out, "We must do something. Please, please do something!"

Ms. Reedy, who was staring at the cloak too, seemed to snap herself out of a trance. She unclipped her traveling cloak, inched towards Avalong, and threw it over Avalon's unconscious form. She turned to the driver, "Now, will you help me?"

Tara looked at him as well, tears in her eyes, "Please I beg you."

The driver took a deep breath, as if summoning up his courage, then stepped forward wordlessly to help Ms. Reedy pick up Avalon. As they moved her towards the carriage, a trickle of blood trailed behind her.

"Ms. Reedy," Tara said, "she's bleeding. Look."

"We'll put her in the carriage. Tara and I will ride in front with you Gregory."

Gregory replied in a resigned tone, "Yes, ma'am."

***

Once they arrived Ms. Reedy instructed Gregory to inform the household of what had happened. While he disappeared in the house, Tara and Ms. Reedy coaxed Avalon out of the carriage, careful to keep her wrapped up tight. Tara's father appeared at the cottage's threshold visibly distraught. Gregory was behind him. The rest of the house staff had come to the front door as well, alerted to something happenning by the general commotion. 

Once they began to realize what was happening they shrank back inside. Tara's father stepped forward and instructed Gregory to fetch the doctor from town. Her father turned to Tara and Ms. Reedy and said, "We must take her to the observatory. Follow me."

Tara was surprised by her father's instructions. She had never been allowed to see the observatory, much less enter it. For as long as she remembered it was forbidden. Not even Avalon would tell her much about the structure. Tara and Ms. Reedy struggled to advance a few steps with Avalon, but struggled with the burden.

Her father who was outpacing them, stopped and turned back, "Avalon, we must get you to the observatory." As if sensible to his instructions, she nodded her head weakly, then shrugged off Tara and Ms. Reedy's help and began plodding her way after Tara's father. They disappeared behind a hedgerow, leaving Tara standing in the front yard, with bloodied hands, wondering what would happen to Avalon.

Ms. Reedy guided Tara inside and tried to keep her as occupied as she could. This was difficult to do. Tara found herself overcome with restless energy. She was unable to sit for more than a few minutes at a time. She paced back and forth, interrupted only by her attempts to focus on whatever task Ms. Reedy placed in front of her.

After some time passed, Tara could hear the carriage approaching down the lane and look out of her bedroom window. She could see her father waiting outside for them. His worried looked concerned Tara even more than she already had been. Finding Avalong collapsed in the middle of the road had been alarming enough, but maybe, just maybe she was overreacting. 

In all of her pacing and worrying, she realized how little she really knew about Avalon and what her long journeys entailed. She knew that Avalon would leave for long periods of time--sometimes weeks, sometimes month. Then reappear. Her reappearance would mean that her father, usually lost in his studies and work, was even less available than usual. A day or two would pass and Avalon would reintegrate herself in to their daily lives--eatign with them, taking walks, reading in the garden. 

Then she would be gone again. Being gone usually meant more stories. So, for Tara, these absenseces were well worth the wait, especially recently, when Tara relished stories about the outside world more than ever. Avalon could have recounted every minute of every expereince she had ever had or heard about and it still wouldn't have been enough for Tara. 

Finally Gregory brought the horses to a jerking halt. The doctor alighted from the carriage and met her father who led the doctor back to the observatory, where he had taken Avalon, where she could not see what was happen and could only wait until something happened that she could know about.

***

The days event wore Tara down to point that she fell asleep once she sat in bed later that evening. Everything after their return home existed only as a vague blurry memory. She hardly felt like she had been present for most of it. Not that anything of consequence had happened. In fact, the remainder of the day had been spent waiting, listening, hoping for some news about Avalon. 

No news came, only that the doctor was dispatched several hours later. Her father never returned to dinner and Tara asked Ms. Reedy meekly that broth and bread be brough to her room for dinner.

Ms. Reedy was uncharacteristically gentle and accommodating towards Tara in these hours. She quietly went down to the kitchen and returned with the requested meal. They both sat in silence until she finished. At which point, Ms. Reedy announced that she would be retiring for the night. Tara nodded and sat in her window seat until the maid came to change her into her night clothes.

She fell asleep fast but it was restless sleep. Half formed visions kept her tossing and turning. At some point a sharp cracking noise sounding in the distance startled her awake. After more tossing and turning, she couldn't fall back asleep and resolved to see what the sound might be.

As she went downstairs she could hear muted voices--a man and a woman. Her heart leapt. Maybe Avalon was better and downstairs. She turned into the kitchen only to find her father and the Bettina, the cook. Her father was sitting at rustic table that served as a work surface and dining table for the small staff that ran their house.

Her father sat there, shrinking inwards at the shoulders, hovering over a fresh cup of tea. He sipped from it and noticed Tara. She would see signs of exhaustion covered his face. Normally a thin, frail looking man, her father was, nonetheless, full of mental vitality--a vitality that animated that thin face. Now the animation was gone, replaced by fatigue, maybe even sadness.

"Tara, what are you doing downstairs?"

"I had trouble sleeping , papa, and heard noises downstairs."

"Bettina is already at her morning tasks, and offered to make me a cup of tea when she saw a light on in my study."

"Would you like one, miss?" Bettina asked from her crouching position by the fire grate.

"No, thank you Bettina. I think it would make me too nervous."

The cook kindly replied, "Bless you child, we're all worked up like sharpened knives on account of our poor Avalon."

Tara's father nodded absently and sipped at his tea. He took another sip before looking at her again. A thought seemed to pass through his mind in that moment. His face was animated again, as if waking up from a stupor. "Since you are awake, let's retire to my study. I would like to talk with you."

This announcement surprised Tara. She was rarely allowed in her father's study. And what would he would he want to talk about with her? She dutifully followed her father's slouching, sliding form through the dark halls to his study. He motioned her inside towards a chair near his desk. As she sat, he pulled the heavy pocket doors closed. 

A single candle flickered on his desk, having almost burned down to the base. He brought over two other canldes from a table near the wall of book cases and lit them both from the dying one. When he sat down at his desk, his eyes reflected the quivering candle flames, seeming like two points of light about to fade out of existence.

He gave a great sigh and just say for a moment. Tara sat silently too, clutching her knees together and her hands tightly in her lap. A chill ran over her, brough about in part by the cold still air in the study. Typically there would be a hearty fire going to keep her father warm while he worked. The hearth had been scrapped clean long enough ago what was left of the fire's heat had fled the room.

At last, her father drew himself up and began to speak. He didn't speak to her, but more around her. The effect made her feel far away from him, like an audience member of a perforamnce taking place on a stage. 

"I have learned something tonight that has caused a great disturbance," he began.

"About Avalon? And her injuries," she replied in a nearly whispering tone. "Are her injuries grave ones?"

"No, the doctor says with rest and clean dressings she will recover soon enough. We are lucky in that regard."

Tara immediately felt relieved, but her father didn't seem to be. She didn't undertand why. "If it's not her injuries, then what is bothering you papa?"

"From what I can understand of Avalon's account, she was attacked."

"Attaked? By who?"

"Again, I can't say with absolute certainty, but it sounds like Avalon was attacked by members of the King's Guard."

"Why would soldiers want to attack Avalon?"

"Tara, there is much you don't know about Avalon." Her father ran his hands through his aging, thinning hair. "Perhaps I have kept you too sheltered from the world. Well, no matter, tonight is not the night to rectify such mistakes, certainly not all at once..." He trailed off in an abstract daze of thought, until he snapped back when she replied to him.

"I am not too young to understand, papa, please tell me. Knowing halves of things is worse than knowing the whole of something, no matter how bad it might be."

"That might be, but it is late, and I want to unburden my mind before it is much later."

"Then tell me, papa, I beg you."

"Avalon plays a very special role in the kingdom, and part of my job is to see that this job is performed well. If Avalon is not able to perform her duty, then I am not able to. People like Avalon..."

"Vigilants?" Tara offered.

Her father looked puzzled by the word, "Yes, this is what they're called by many common people. Vigilants are protected by the monarch. It is a grave crime to lay hands on someone like Avalon, a vigilant. Doing so put the vigilant at risk, but so much more," her father paused here, worry creeping all over his face in the shadows. "Oh, I am having trouble even saying this directly. Avalon insists that she was attacked, but not just attacked by anyone, which would be a henious act."

"Then who attacked her father?"

"Avalon insists it was members of the King's Guard."

"But if she is under the king's protection..." Tara trailed off, still struggling to put the bits and pieces of information her father was dropping into something coherent.

"Yes, exactly, then the new King has rescinded his protection, and the whole project is threatened. And because of this I have come to a difficult decision. I have... I have decided to resign from my position in protest."

"Leave your position over this? Papa, are you sure? This seems so drastic, so sudden. What will happen if you do this?"

"Tara, please, I feel with my full heart and mind that this is the right course of action. If I had someway of conveying my thoughts with more haste to the king, I would do so, especially if it relieved me of this terrible burden I feel myself carrying. Since I cannot do that, I must do the next best thing."

"What is that?"

"I must travel to the capital and tender my resignation, and my protest, before the king, in person."

"In person? To the capital? But papa, we are supposed to be traveling to the captial."

"Yes, Tara, which is why I wanted to speak to you without delay, so that you would understand the importance and urgency of our traveling to the capital as soon as we are able."

"But we are already traveling to the capital, for my..." The sad look in her father's eyes helped Tara understand the implication of his decision. "Then my trip..."

"I am sorry, Tara. I know you were looking forward to this trip. I'm afraid it will have a rather different tenor now."

"But the balls and parties?"

"We will see. I cannot predict how my news will be received. I can only hope that the new King will understand my concern and decision come from a place of loyalty and pride and not treason."

"Treason, papa? That is a scary word."

"Indeed." He signed heavily. "We cannot predict the future with the walls of this study. Let's return to our chambers and try to gain what little sleep we can until the sun rises."

Tara stood to leave, saying goodnight to her father as she left to return to her room where she sat stunned until fatigue compelled her to sleep.

# Chapter 3 #

Resign, resign, resign. Tara repeated the word to herself over and over. It danced through her mind for some reason. She could not chase it and capture it to rid it's snake like sounds from her memory. So the word followed her throughout the day. The word was there when her father assembled the house's small staff to make his announcement. Tara watched as looks of confusion, maybe even fear crossed the staff's faces. Only Ms. Reedy remained stoic in the face of the news.

Not long afterwards, she knocked on Tara's door and entered solemnly. Tara looked up from her book and merely said, "Ms. Reedy."

She replied with a curt "Tara."

"Is something wrong? You never gave me any lessons, so I decided to read instead." Ms. Reedy did not move and speak. So Tara added, "Ms. Reedy you are worrying me. Please say something."

Ms. Reedy started to speak in a halting way, "I have spoken with your father and have submitted by resignation to him. I will be leaving later this afternoon."

Resigned, there was that word again. Like an imp, it played and preyed on her feelings. She wished she would never hear that word again. Tara surprised herself, and certainly Ms. Reedy, by launching herself towards Ms. Reedy and embracing her in a tearful hug.

Ms. Reedy stiffened and nervously patted her head. Tara did not think she had ever hugged Ms. Reedy before. She cheek pressed against the bone stays in Ms. Reedy's dress and her arms coiled around the folds of her dress. Had she been asked, she probably could not even fully explain why she hugged Ms. Reedy, but the impulse to do it overwhelmed her.

Finally, Ms. Reedy pulled her away and rearranged her dress. She wiped a suggestion of a tear away from the corner of her eye. True to herself and her maxims, through, Ms. Reedy maintained her composure and did not let emotion rule over this moment.

"I have left instructions with the staff to help with the final preparations for your trip."

"Where will you go, Ms. Reedy?"

"I will travel north where I have a brother who is a magistrate. From there, who can say? But I feel that my time here has come to and end."

"And what about me?"

"I do not know, Tara. That is the most honest answer I can give you. I wish I knew, but now your path is unclear. You must take what I have taught you and try your best to navigate life's currents."

"I wish I understood why papa is doing this. Do you think it is right?"

"Right? That is not for me to say. Your father holds a very esteemed position in the kingdom and has served the kingdom loyally. He feels that there has been an affront to his reputation and must take this action. The decision will not be without consequence, I'm afraid. But fearing consequences shouldn't determine our sense of right and wrong."

Tara felt serious all of a sudden and considered what Ms. Reedy said. She nodded her head, "I feel that to be true."

"Then my work here is done.

###

With Ms. Reedy gone, Tara wasn't sure what she would do with her days, or what remained of her days. The only bright spot during the slow passing of these dull days was the delivery of her new dress. When it was taken to her room, she opened the box and felt her heart race in excitment, but as soon as she closed it back up, the moment passed and the dress faded from her mind.

There was no news about Avalon and her recovery. The doctor had not visited again, leading Tara to assume that Avalon would get better sooner rather than later. Tara wanted to search her out. Avalon's room remained empty. Tara knew this after checking it several times throughout the day. She assumed that Avalon was still in the observatory. Going there wasn't a possibility since the observatory was off limites to her.

Tara knew that the observatory was central to her father's work, but she didnt' fully understand how. After all, he spent most of his time in the study in the cottage, doing whatever he did there. But always upon Avalon's returned he would disppaer for the observatory, sometimes for long stretches of time. He would be back in his office, then disappaer again. Once Avalon left again on another journey, he would settle back into his routine in the house.

She also knew that others in the household held the observatory to be a place to be feared, at least avoided. Many avoided talking about it altogether. As she paced around the house, she thought more about her father's passing comment that he had kept too much from her.

As she turned over this comment in her mind, she wondered what he meant by that. She could assume it had something to do with Avalon, with his position. But beyond that she had so few bits of knowledge to cling on to to even start to speculate. She knew she lived a sheltered life and didn't understand much of the outside world. Avalon made that clear, even Ms. Reedy made that clear. But that restless desire to burst out into the world that she felt so often, as recently as the other day, suddenly changed into something more unsettling. Tara began to look at her immediate surroundings and feel that maybe things weren't as they seemed. 

To rid herself of this feeling, she decided to walk through the woods surrounding their cottage. There were numerous trails beat back by hunters and the hunted alike through the woods. One path in particular, her favorite, wound its way down to a creek that cut through the woods. She determiend that this would be her path. 

Unfortunatley, once she was in the woods, picking up the trail was harder than she had remembered. She wandered around for some time before she she could make out the path. It helped that she remembered that hunters had notched several of the trees to mark the path when they were covered with snow in the winter.

After winding along the meandering trail, she arrived at the place where the creek's rocky bed cut tthe forest in two. The water was low and the creek was little more than a trickle. She sat in the grass regardless and watched the water flowing over and around the rocks, finding the small paths to rush through on its course.

When she was a little girl, she had spent hours in the forest, by this creek, playing out elaborate stories with a cast of characters she conjured in her mind. She could only faintly recall those characters now, but she did remember the elaborate conversations she would have have out loud with them. How strange it must have seemed to overhear a little girl's half of a conversation, chattering on and one with no replies, only breaks of silence where other words should have been.

That had been before Ms. Reedy had come into the picture, befor her father started to become aware that he would need to prepare his daughter for something. She had a nurse for many years, the same nurse that had tended to her since she was an infant, when her mother, a person who she had no memory of, had died suddenly during a plague year. The nurse was growing old and wanted to live out her days with her daughters in her home village.

Her father released her from service, which percipitated something of a crisis in the household. This was the time when she had the most freedom to romp about and be a bit more wild than Ms. Reedy woudl ever had allowed. In fact, Tara could remember distinctly Ms. Reedy uttering words, "Absolutely feral," at the end of her first week with her new charge.

Ms. Reedy had not said this to Tara direclty, of course. But Tara could overhear Ms. Reedy talking loudly to her father. She knew from her experience with her previous two governesses that her father had little patience for managing these affairs. That conversation between Ms. Reedy and her father had ended with a curt, "Yes, sir" and a closing door. After that Ms. Reedy approached Tara with a iron-like resolve to mould her into something suitable beyond "life in the wilderness" as she liked to put it.

Tara didn't know if she was ready for life outside of this place or not. For so long, leaving home was something far off, something she would do as the first step in a grand adventure. And now the crisp crinkle of the leaves, the gurgle of the stream filled Tara with a longing for things to stay the same, for nothing to change. But it was going to change and she felt powerless to stop it.

Footsteps in the woods interrupted her reverie by the creek. She stood to leave before hearing her name whispered in the woods, a soft faint "Tara...Tara..." trickling out through the trees. She stopped and watched carefully as Avalon appeared, stepping gingerly over branches and foliage, holding her side which had been heavily bandaged.

She wore a robe, but not the robe of swirling eyes that Tara had seen her in before. Her robe was just a simple one that grazed over the ground as she walked. Avalon stopped in front of her and gave a weak smile, "I remembered that you liked this place."

Tara moved to wrap her arms around Avalon, but she stopped her with a wincing retreat. "It hurts too much, not right now." Tara stepped back, slightly embarassed. Avalon added, "Help me down, I should like to sit with you for a while. It's so peaceful here."

Sitting beside Avalon, Tara did not feel the peace herself. She was used to feeling a sense of calm around Avalon, excitement too, but a feeling that things were right and as they should be. This feeling, though, felt far away, replaced with a fidgeting discontent. Tara spoke up, "I don't feel peaceful."

Avalon gave her a sad smile and patted her bandged wounds, "Is it because of this?"

Tara considered for a moment, "I suppose so. Everything is changing. Nothing seems the same."

"The Tara that I knew would be excited by the idea. I always feared I would run out of stories to tell you to, would be unable to satiate your appetite for adventure."

"Perhaps. But nothing about this seems exciting. I don't understand why papa is resigned, leaving our home. And our trip. What's to become of me in the capital?"

"These are good questions. I wish I had answere to them."

Tara was silent and then looked at Avalon, "What exactly happened to you? Please help me understand."

"Tara, I do not claim to understand, and only have a vague recollection of what happened. Your father should know more soon. But it is an arduous process." She sighed again, then continued, "I have walked through many corners of this world, as you know. But perhaps even more than you realize. I am bound by a duty to walk to see, to witness events as they unfold in the kingdom."

Tara thought about the people in the village and their strange manner as she approached, "Is that why people reacted so strangely to you in the village?"

Avalon seemed confused by this question, perhaps not fully remembering everything that transpired the other day. "Perhaps so. It is one of the effects that my presence has on people. I am always appart when I am wearing the cloak and walking. I must be."

"In order to see?"

"In order to see clearly, to be vigilant." Tara rememebred the villagers using that word. It was one she was unfamiliar with, certainly in relation to Avalon, who was just Avalon to her.

For Tara, Avalon was this soft spoken gentle person, who told wild stories about the world. As she considered this, Tara realized that so many of Avalon's stories were about others and not herself. They were stories not about her own experiences, but things she had seen. Listening to those stories, Tara had been able to insert herself into any role she chose, much as she did when she read a story or fairy tale. But Avalon was not a part of them at all.

Avalon shook her head and looked far off, "It's all so unclear now, but I remember finding someone wounded, a boy, who was hiding in a hedgerow. He was terrified, in no small part because of my presence, I'm sure. I knew I shouldn't try to help him, but something moved me to do so. I couldn't stand to see his fear and hurt so up close, so intimately. But then we were surrounded by soldiers. Not just any soldiers, or so I recall, but members of the King's Guard. Elite soldiers. I just remembered being roughly used and then feeling a stabbing pain."

"What happened to the boy?" Tara asked.

"I do not know. I do not know who he was, or why they were after him, but they did not want me to assist him. And this is the result."

Tara took Avalon to mean her wound, but she also extended it to mean what was happeening now, to her, to her father. She could only respond with, "It doesn't seem fair."

"What doesn't?" Avalon asked.

"Any of this. It doesn't seem right or fair..." Tara trailed off.

"That what happeend in some far corner of the kingdom has set off ripples of effects that you are now feeling first hand?"

"I...I guess that is it."

"Tara, one of the blessings of your life up to now, is that you have been able to be blissfully unaware of how moments in one place affect moments in another place. We all live under the influence of forces we cannot see and sometimes cannot know. I have struggled mightly with this role, this mantle that I was tok to take up when I was not much older than you. I did not fully understand why, perhaps I don't even fully understand now. Yet I did what I was told to do, and here we are."

Tara pulled her knees in closer to the body and wrapped her arms around them. "I'm so afraid. I wish papa wasn't being so rash. Why does anyone need to know? Why couldn't he just keep this secret and not tell anyone, just let live go on the way it's supposed to?"

"I can only imagine that your father feels a responsibilty to take these actions. You must realize that he is trying to do the right thing, the best thing, in this situation. You must trust his judgment and hope for the best."

***

Later that evening, just as she was preparing for bed, Tara's father entered her room. He rarely did this, usually having some emissary to attend to her needs on his behalf. It was strange having him in her room and Tara wasn't quite sure what to do with herself. She stood awkwardly in the middle of the room waiting for him to speak. Her father stood in the room without saying anything. He looked haggard and troubled. He held a large portfolio that was bound up in cord under his arm. 

"What is that papa?" she asked him, wanting to break the silence in any way she could.

"This? My work. I finished my work and this the the full account of what Avalon saw and what happened to her."

"Do you mean what the cloak saw?"

Her shifted shifted uncomfortably, "Yes, I suppose it is. How did you know?"

"Avalon hinted at this. She didn't tell me much, but I understand a little more than I did before."

"We don't have time to go into it all now, suffice to say, that I spent many hours completing this record. It is the record that I will deliver to the king."

"Have you changed your mind about decision, papa?"

"No, if anything, this taks has strengthed my resolve. Come what may, I feel strongly that I can no longer perform my tasks in light of what happened."

Tara lowered her head, "I see."

Her father weakly countereed her disappointment with, "There is always a chance that the king will not accept my resignation. I'm one of only a few recorders left. There are not many of us. It has taken me years to develop my skills to the level they are now. I'm not easily replaceable."

"Then why do this, papa? I keep asking the question in my mind over and over again, and still do not have a good answer to it."

"Tara, to do what I do and to send Avalon out into the world to do what she does, I must know that the threat of violence or disruption doesn't hang over every moment. I strive to capture the truth of what Avalong sees in her journeys. I try to capture an accurate record. In doing so, I am protecting the past, present, and the future, providing tools so that other might understand. Now, I feel that this is under threat. Perhaps the mere suggestion of my resignation will force the king to reconsider his actions. It is worth taking this chance if this is the outcome."

He said good night and left her room. Tara tossed in bed trying to sleep. Had she known that it would be her last in this room, this bed, this home, the only one she had known, perhaps she would have slept more soundly to reslish the experience. Or perhaps she would have been spent the night completely wide-eyed, awake, trying to take in any and every sensation she could to remember later when she was very, very far away from home.

# Chapter 4 #

They set out later than her father wanted. He paced and worried over the slow progress that preparations were taking. The house staff had dwindled to just two people--Frannie, the maid, and Gregory the driver. The few others who had remained left early that morning, finishing their essential chores, and leaving notes in the kitchen announcing their intention to find work elsewhere.

Frannie helped her pack the rest of her things. Tara worried over whether or not to bring her new dress. She reasoned over it with Frannie for long time, trying to work out whether or not they would still be calling on anyone or attending any parties. Frannie, who was doing her best to stay busy while Tara worked this out out loud, did her best to keep up with a series of "I think so" and "That sounds right, Miss Tara." 

Tara finally talked it over so much that Frannie had run out of tasks to do. Tara realized that she was standing there holding the very dress they were discussing. Tara sighed and said, "I suppose we should bring it if there is room."

"Just barely, and if I rearrange a few things, we can do so without damaging it." She handed Tara some of the incidentals that had been used to fill out the trunk and handed them to Tara. Tara packed these items--a quarto of paper that she had sewn together herself. a drawing pad and charcoals, and several books--in a small traveling case that would sit neatly on top of her trunk..

When the time came to get her trunk downstairs, there was no one to help. Frannie had been called away by her father for some task or another. So, Tara did her best to drag her trunk down from her room. It bounced down the staircase and nearly exploded in the hallway. But she righted it and got it outside. Gregory stepped in and hoisted the trunk on his shoulder and attach it to the back of the carriage.

Finally, everything was packed which meant that it was time to be underway. Avalon appeared at the front of the house, standing next to Frannie, to see them off. Gregory helped Tara's father and herself into the carriage, before aligthing it himself to get them underway.

The reins popped and he muttered a quick, "Hiyah". The carraige lurched forward. Tara looked out the window and waved at Avalon, watching as the house and the two people left in it was clipped out of view by the bend in the road into the forest.

As they traveled along the rough carriage roads, Tara tried to take in as much as she could. She wanted to remember every detail of this journey. Despite the fact that the trip was now tinged with the sadness of her father's resignation, she still clung to the fact that she had never been to the capital before now. She was still as excited as the version of herself from several days ago had been about the prospect of the trip.

The road to the capital took them through the village, which had been the furthest place from her home that Tara had ever been. Once they cleared the buildings and the fields surrounding the village, she was entering country that she had never seen before.

The trip should have been a long day's journey, as her father never tired of reminding her. Afternoon rain storms conspired with their late start to slow down their progress considerably. A farmers cart had overturned on the road, which required Gregory to stop the carriage and assist them calming the horses and righting the wagon. The road was just wide enough for them to skirt around farmer adn continue on their way.

In the gray, dismal weather, Tara grew sleepy and didn't notice that it was getting dark out. She could half hear her father say, "I think we had better stop for the nigth soon." He gave instructions to Gregory to look out for a roadside establishment where they could stay for the night.

When her father nudged her awake, the rain was just a trickle rolling off the trees and buildings, but it was very dark out. She stepped out onto a wooden plank that extended through the muddy grass in front of the inn where they were taking lodging. 

Inside the inn, a fire blazed and a few laterns burned, giving out whatever light and heat they could. She kept close by her father, surprised by the glowering guests huddled at the tables around the inn's main area. She followed her father to an empty table. A boy about her age brought them water and bread, soon followed by a warm stew. 

Tara had not grown up with fancy foods, but she was used to more refined fare than what was on offer here. The bread was seedy and tart. The stew meat was tough and gamey tasting. She picked at the food at first, then finally let her hunger overcome any delicate feelings she might have been feeling.

After their meal, the same boy led them upstairs to a small, cold room with a rough hewn bed. Ropes lashed around the frames kept a lumpy mattress in place. The boy lit the stove in the corner of the room and stoked the fire to bring it to life. Once he returned with hot water for wash bowl, Tara and her father prepared for bed.

As requested, they were awoken early the next morning and found hot tea and toasted bread and butter waiting for them downstairs. Gregory joined them at the table. They all ate silently before Gregory dismissed himself to prepare the horses. Other travelers were coming and going through the inn, taking little notice of her and her father. 

It struck her that no one knew who they were here. Even though her father was not a powerful landlord or magistrate, she was used to nodding heads and small acts of deference in the people around her. Here they were yet more cold, tired travelers crossing the kingdom's lands for one purpose or another.

Their purpose that day was to arrive in the capital with as much haste as possible. The closer they got to the capital, the more worry seeemed to overtake her father. He shifted restlessly in the carriage, muttering to himself, as if rehearsing lines for a play. Tara tried to read but the bouncing carriage made her feel sick. So she leaned into the side and closed her eyes, hoping to fall asleep.

She awoke in a foggy daze to a din of people, animals, and wagons around them. She looked out the carriage windows and was ovwhelemed by the sheer number of things happened around them. A farmer was cracking a whip to lead a herd of cattle down the road. A group of soldiers were walking casually, singing loud boisterous songs. Everywhere she looked there were riders and carriages and people and they were all trained in one direction--towards the capital.

"Look, papa, there it is!" she called out, leaning dangerously out of the small window.

"Do be careful, Tara," her pleaded. He turned and looked out as well.

Directly in front of them, large stone pilings rose out of water that ran before the city, holding up a bridge that was the choke point for all of this traffic. On the other side of the river buildings scurried up the hillside in maze-like patterns, crushing up against the forbidding stone walls that surrounded the capital's inner keep. Within those stone walls, spires seemed to spring out at random until the one large structure dominated them all.

"The Grand Hall," her father said pointing to that structure. "The king's residence, the court. The heart of our kingdom," he explained.

"Will we go there?" Tara asked.

"Once we are settled, I will send a messenger to announce my arrival and my wish to see the king. Hopefully, I will be granted an audience and deliver my message. It cannot come soon enough."

Tara looked lovingly at her father and replied, "Do not worry, papa. I'm sure everything will be fine. You've always said that the king's father was good and noble. Surely his son will be the same. I'm sure he will be gracious when you pay your respects."

"Yes, I hope you are right."

***

By the time they entered the city, Tara already felt like she had had enough of it. Just crossing the bridge had taken an another hour. No matter where they turned, there were people and things clogging the roads. Tara could hear Gregory continually trying to settle the horses who were skittish in the midst of so much distraction.

They finally made their way to the section of the city where travelers would find "services to their liking", or so one passerby they asked for directions had told them. Her father pointed out a guesthouse that seemed respectable enough and went inside to reserve their room. 

With their trunks unloaded and delivered to their room, her father gave the young man helping them a small tribute in form a few coins then impressed upon him the need to find a messengar to deliver a notes to the palace gates.

Cleary confused by the request, the young man regarded him with a curious expression, "The palace gates are closed most days, sir. The general public's not been allowed to pass just to and from for well over a year now."

"That is very well, but I am here on a matter of some urgency and sensitivity. It is of the utmost importance that my arrival be known to the king."

Her father held out a few more coins and the young man took them readily and said, "I'll do my best, sir."

Several minutes later, the young man returned with a boy and announcing that he had returned with a messenger. Her father eyed the boy, ruddy checks, somewhat threadbare clothes, his britches spotted with dirt from another day's rain. "I was hoping for someone...a bit more official."

"I'm sorry sir, but we don't get many people of the official sort around here. When we do, we generally don't look on it too favorably, if you take my meaning. IT usually spells no good for ourselves.

"Yes, I take your meaning, young man. Can he be trusted?" The man and the boy stayed silent momentarily, "Well, boy what say you?"

"Me, sir? I run all sorts of errands around these parts. I bring around bread and beer to the workmen. I fetch horses, all sorts of things."

"I have here an important letter that I need delivered with haste. Can you do it?"

"I think I can and jump right into it too."

"Very well then." Her father produced a letter from the folio case he carried with him and had sat on the bed. "This is the letter. And here is a downpayment for you troubles."

The boy wasn't used to having metal dropped in his hands like the young man was. His eyes lit and he dashed out of the room. They could hear him clomping down the stairs and out into the street.

The young man bowed and took his leave, leaving Tara and her father alone in the small room. Her father turned to her and said, "And now we wait."

***

Several hours passed before a knock finally came at the door. Tara and her father had both dozed off, partly due to the fatigue from traveling, but also from the intense late afternoon sun that warmed up their room.

The knock starteled Tara awake. She looked over to find her father more asleep than she. She sat up and rocked him genty, "Papa, someone is at the door."

"Huh? The door? Yes, right away." The knocking continued. It was a quiet but steadfast knocking. Her father sat up as well and rubbed his hands quickly over his face to invigorate himself. He spoke up more loudly, "Coming, coming..."

As he walked to the door he rearranged his shirt, smoothed his breeches and coat out. Tara realized that he was trying to make himself presentable, though she wondered why. Would the kind be appearing here in their room? She stood too, just in case that happened to be how things unfolded.

When her father opened the door and saw the same young man as before standing here, they both seemed to deflate a little. Certainly her father's sigh spoke to a sense of disappointment. "Do you have any word from the palace?" her father asked. 

"No sir, not exatly." Her father stepped back and sighed. He was so eager to execute this task that every little delay seemed to be waring on him. Her father started to close the door but the man spoke up, "There's more. There is someone here to see you." 

"From the palace?"

"I can't rightly say. Older gentleman. Somewhat plainly dressed."

"You may send him up, then."

"That's just it, sir. He insisted that you come down."

"I see." Her father seemed to be thinking through what this might mean. "Is there a private room we might use to confer with this visitor for a short time?"

"Private room? Not exactly, not for guests. I suppose you could make use of the back parlor that the family that runs the inn maintains for itself. I would need to ask permission of course."

"Please do, then we will be right down."

"Yes, sir." The young man disappeared to inquire about the room then reappeared, "I'll show you the way."

He led them down a back stair case that as hidden behind a paneled door, "Pardon the servant's stairs, but it's the most convenient." Her father didn't say anything, so Tara interjected a quiet, "Not at all" to be polite.

They entered a small room with a fireplace, dark wood paneling, and dark, overstuffed furniture. Standing with his back to the room, looking out the window, was a tall man dressed in a long dark coat and dark trousers. He turned to reveal an old gaunt face decorated with a thick gray beard. Yet in spite of the profusion of gray hair and wrinkled skin, the man exuded a sense of power from this broad shoulders and glinting eyes. 

Those same eyes sized them both up, her in particular. She could feel his gaze linger on her, as if cataloging all of her traits and qualities for some future purpose. She felt evaluated, summed up in this simple action.

"Please sit," the man said to them. "You may leave us," he instructed the young man. All parties obeyed him without hesitation. He sat in one of the arm chairs opposite them, but perched on the very edge of the cushion. "So, I am to understand that you wish an audience with the king?"

"Yes, that is correct. I have urgent business with him."

"Mmmm, of course. Do you have your credentials?"

Now it was her father's turn to straighten himself up, "Credentials? I said who I saw in my note and stated my intention clearly enough. That has always sufficed in the past."

"Perhaps, but I am responsibble for the ways of today, not of the past. Besides if you are who you are, it has been, what? Some fifteen years since you have paid his majesty a visit. And I am to assume from some street urchin's note announcing the presence of one of the king's recorders in the capital, that said recorder has decided to make his presence known."

Tara couldn't help but interject into the conversation on behalf of her father, "My father has served the kingdom loyally and well for as long as I can remember?"

The old man looked at her with a flat deadpan expression, "And how far back does your memory go, young lady?"

Her father stood, "This is an outrage. I'm being treated like a common subject. My position used to be held with revernce and esteem, particuarly by functionaries of the court."

The man smiled, "No doubt. But this functionary stand between you and your request to access the court. And this functionary has been asked to review your credentials, per the king's orders."

The moment of defiance was over as the color drained from her father's face. He sat back down and produced a small quarto sheet of paper that had been neatly folded and still bore a wax seal on it. The man stood to collect them and moved to the window to inspect them in the full light of the window.

He turned back to them and said, "I will be keeping these for further review. I suggest that you not venture far from this inn, as you will be under surveillance until your credentials can be properly verified." With that he collected a tall dark hat to round out his costume, tipped it to them both, bid them good day, and left them alone in the room to reflect further on what had just happened.

***

Her father paced their room, fuming, in his quiet nervous way about the treatment he had just received. "This is outrageous," he cried out. "Unheard of. I have loyally served the king and the king's father before him. If he learned anything from his father, the king should know not to trifle with someone in my position. I know many things, many secrets. A person in my position should be held in esteemed, not degraded like this." 

Tara had never seen her father fume like his, never seen him talk about his status and position in such a a away as to elevate himself above others. Yet here he was in this small room in an inn somehwere in the capital city asseting that he was important and needed to be heard and taken seriously.

Her father paused, "Do you think the King knows why I am here?"

Tara finally ventured a quiet reply, not wanting to inflame her father's nervous agitation any more than was necessary, "I cannot say."

"That man, that foul functionary spoke of spies." Her father looked around, though at what Tara could not say exactly, "Perhaps there are spies everywhere. Do you think there were spies in our household?"

"Papa, who would have been a spy?"

"Maybe..." her father rubbed his chin vigoursly, making a rasping sound as he fingers grazed the day old stubble on his cheeks, "Maybe Ms. Reedy. She disappeared suddenly once she learned the news."

"Papa, please listen to yourself. Ms. Reedy? She was with us for years."

"Waiting, as spies do. I must get to the bottom of this. This is simply unfathomable, unbelievable."

Tara finally stood up and rested her hands on her father's shoulders. They were normally curved in slightly, presumably from the time he spent hunched over his work, but there were even more bowed in on themselves now. When she touched him, the coil of energy that was propelling him around the room unwound. He nearly went limp. 

She steered him towards the bed and suggested he rest. "Would you like a cup of tea, father?" He nodded yes and closed his eyes, sighing as he did so.

Tara rang a small bell and a young woman appeared this time at their door. She was about the same age as the young man. They resembled each other so much that Tara assumed they were brother and sister.

"Yes?" the young woman asked in a tone that was neighter friendly or unfriendly, helpful or unhelpful. She didn't seem particlarly harried, but didn't seem to relish her job either.

"My father needs rest, and a cup of tea to calm him. Would you send one up?"

"Yes, is that all?" 

The woman turned to leave, "And one more thing, is there a market nearby? I would like to purchase from fresh fruit for him as well."

There is, in the square a few blocks from here. There won't be much left at this time of day, but that's for you the decide if it's worth your time and all."

"Thank you," Tara replied and timidly reached out to give the young woman a coin in payment. 

The young woman turned it over in her hand and frowned, slipped it into her apron and disappeared downstairs. 

When her father was situated with tea and a small cake, Tara put on her traveleing cloak with it deep dark hood and set out to find the market.

She wandered into the street, not aware of the carts and people swirling around her and heading towards her. Several passerbys shouted out curses to her to move. Tara reeled at first, then got her bearings, and proceeded to find the market. She immeditaly saw that someone was following her from the other side of the street, but decided to ignore this for now. After all, the man had warned them that her and her father would be followed.

She finally found her way to the market, rows of shabby tents that huddled in the middle of a clearing. Around the edge of the clearing, buildings teetered on each other, some reaching up several stories. Being in the market gave Tara the sensation of having been swallowed by a gaping mouth. The buildings seeemd to loom and threatened to close her up.

A mixture of organic smells pervaded the market, from the produce that was ripeneing in the afternoon sun, animals that were waiting to be purchased. She stepped over tricles of blood from meat that had been freshly slaughtered. And the people. She bumped into and bounced off of the people who were jostling in the market to make their purchases.

Tara walked the aisles of the market several times before finding a merchant with fruit that seemed to be of the quality she was used to. An old woman sat on a crate and eyed her suspiciously while she picked through the apples. Finally the woman snapped, "One's as good another. Make a decision."

Instictively Tara replied, "Yes, ma'am. I didn't mean any offense."

The woman sneered at her, not caring to hear Tara's apologies and polite words. "Do you have coin for the purchase?"

Tara fetched the money from small pouch tied around her wrist that she kept hidden in the sleeve of her dress. She handed over the money then indicated that she wanted a bunch of grapes. She paid for those as well and started to make her way out of the square.

A crowd had gathered at the far end of the market. Tara's wanderings led her to the crowd and she found herself attached to it. Puppeteers had set up and improvised puppet theater and were entertaining the children and adults alike.

Tara decided to stay and watch the show. The cast included a puppet dressed as a king, a knightly soldier, and a peasant farmer. In most of the stories, the king and knight were plotting to one up the peasant--steal his cow, take his land, or trick him into fulfilling some dangerous task. The peasant farmer had the knack of getting out of any scrape and making the king and knight look foolish in the process. 

Much like the audience, Tara found herself smiling and laughing at the foolish exploits of the characters. She glanced over at one point and noticed the man who had been following her, leaning up against a building wall, looking stoic and unamused by the show.

She decided it was best to move on and return to the inn. She was anxious to get the fruit back to her father, hoping it would refresh and revive him. As she turned to leave, she caught a peculiar sight out of the corner of her eye. A figure had its back to her, then turned in profile, at one of the market stalls. The figure held up a basket that received whatever purchase was being made. The figure then turned to leave. Tara insitinctively stepped foward, saying out loud, "Ms. Reedy?"

Tara's voiced seemed to be swallowed up by the din of the crowd in the market. The figure did not stop or pause. Tara tried to push forward through the crowd to get to Ms. Reedy, but could not navigate through the dense layers of elbows and baksets before the person turned and walked away.

From a distance, Tara could just make out the shape of the woman's hat as it bobbed down the aisle between the stalls. The woman, Ms. Reedy, wore a hat that Tara felt she recognized. By recognizing it, she felt sure that this was Ms. Reedy. But what was Ms. Reedy doing here in the capital? Tara clearly remembered her saying that she was heading north to be with family. 

The capital wasn't that far out of the way making it a possible waypoint between Tara's house and her final destination. Besides, many roads led throught the capital, and there was always some reason to visit. Perhaps Ms. Reedy had had such a reason. 

As the figure disappeared from view, Tara realized that the only way to resolve any of these questions was to catch up with Ms. Reedy and ask her directly. She started to move through the crowd with greater resolve, winding her way around people, instead of stopped and starting to determine each person's path like she had been doing. The more she stayed focused on Ms. Reedy, the less she even took notice of the crowd at all. The people became mere blobs of color adn movement to navigate. 

By the time she broke free of the market's congestion, she just managed to catch sight of Ms Reedy walking across the square then turning down one of the narrow side streets that led into the square. Tara tried calling out to her again, but there was no chance of catching the quickly retreating figure's attention that way.

Tara continued her pursuit down these narrow streets--one turn after another. Without realizing it, Tara was moving further and further into a maze of old steets populated with beggars sitting in doorways, mangy dogs lopping along the loose cobblestone, and yet more people coming and going.

She realized now that she could not see Ms. Reedy, had completley lost track of her. Futhermore, she looked around and noticed that the buildings were more squalid than they had before. Windows were broken, doorframes sagging. The people seemed more threadbare, a series of coughs echoed from building to building. Ahead of her a beggar clacked his way down the street, supporting himself with a rustic crutch.

She looked around one more time, completely surprised that Ms. Reedy had not once turned to see a familar, though unexpected face following her. Now she realized that she had a different problem. She wasn't sure how to get home, having lost track of the twists and turns she made following Ms. Reedy. 

She could hear sound from a busier street just up ahead and continued down the small street that led towards the sounds. Before she could reach the street though, she came across two soldiers who were position just outside a dram shop. They were slouching against the wall, sipping from identical tin cups.

One solder was slightly taller than the other, but both and full mustaches that dropped down from their noses and over their mouths. The taller one stood up and said, "Stand attention, Beltran, we have a little lady in our midst."

The shorter one stood at mock attention and saluted, grinning a grin that seemed more sinister than jovial. 

"At ease, Beltran," the taller one jokingly said. They moved to surround Tara. "Where are you off to in the part of town, mi'lady?"

"She might be lost, you know?"

"By jove, I think you might be right, then it would only be fitting for us to return her to her rightful owner."

The shorter one got a hungry look in his eyes, "Maybe there a reward for her?"

"Do you have a reward for your return, mi'lady?"

"No," Tara replied. "I'm looking for my guardian, Ms. Reedy, do you know her?"

Both of the soldiers laughed, but only the one named Beltra replied, "Do we know her? Of course we know her."

Tara's eyes grew wide and hopeful, "You do! Can you take me to her?"

Before the soldiers could reply, a firm hand gripped Tara's arm. The solders looked annoyed, then snapped to attention. Tara looked up and recognized the King's agent who had been following her.

"That's enough of that. You two get back to your patrol before I report you for disorderly conduct."

"Yes, sir," they both replied and bolted back into the street.

The agent look down at her and said in a stern voice, "You have strayed far from the inn and this is not a safe place for a young girl like yourself. Let us return back there before you find yourself in more trouble."

# Chapter 5 #

<!---

Father receives word that he has been granted audience with king
Meet the prince first
King is in the midst of planning a ball, distracted
Invites Tara and her father
At the end of the ball, guards are waiting to arrest her father.

-->

Tara's father woke up the next morning seeming much more refreshed, even optimistic. He asked for tea and porridge for breakfast and nibbled at the fruit that Tara had brought back home. She had been vague about her adventure the day before when she returned home. She even pretended to be surprised when her father pointed out someone that might be one of the king's agents watching them at dinner.

Try as she might, she could not help but dwell on what had happened yesterday. She replayed the events in her mind over and over again. Not only that, but a feeling of being somewhere else came over her. Her father eventually noticed and asked her several times through the morning if everything was okay. "You seemed distracted, Tara."

"I'm fine father," she would reply, weighing in her mind if she tell him what she saw. She wasn't sure why she was hestitating to tell him. She realized that she didn't need to tell him every detail about what happened. What value did holding this secret have for her?

Just before lunch time, a messenger from the court was shown to their room and delivered a sealed note to her father. With the door closed, he turned to sit at the simple table in the corner of the room. He hand shook as he separated the seal from the note then opened it. 

Tara watched as her father's eyes frantically scanned the note back and forth, up and down. He folded it back up and set it on the table. He stood up and straightened himself up. Tara wasn not sure what he was going to say. He had become stern and serious in reaction to the note. 

"Father? What did the note say? Is it bad news?"

Her father looked at her, far away in his own way now and replied, "I am to have my audience later this afternoon. You are invited as well to the see the court."

Tara clapped, "That is wonderful news!" In her excitement, she forgot all about the purpose of the meeting. Her father replied with a grim smile, all to aware of why he was seeking an audience with the king.

They left the inn later for the appointment. They hired a cab to help them navigate the twisting city streets. He pointed a few landmarks that he recognized from the cab, but observed several times how different the capital was. All that Tara could see around her were people coming and going, trash that piled up in the streets, animala and children running here and there. 

They alighted the carraige just before the gates. There was a disorderly line of people stopped before the gates, appealing to the guards to be let in for one reason or another. Her father collected his invitation and the sheafs of paper he had brought from home to present to the king. Two guards stood at either side of the gate, trying to keep the crowd as far back from the gates as possible. Above them, several more guards paced back and forth. One guard carried a long halbard and used it from on high to poke and prod at the people who were not easily pacified. 

Two more guards walked the line on either side, looking over the people standing there carefully. Perhaps they were reviewing each person for certain traits or qualities that might warrant stopping them, but Tara could not tell what those qualities might be. One of these guards stopped in front of a peddlar who has had a pole straddled across his bag, from which several rabbits swung gently as he walked. The guard examined the rabbits and did a cursory search of the peddlar then waved him to the front of the line the gate, shouting out, "Let 'em through."

Tara's father managed to catch the attention of the other guard walking the line. He showed his invitation with the king's seal, trying to explain that they had an audience. The guard flipped the paper over several times, squinted at the seal. It was obvious to Tara that the guard could not read. So he stepped behind them and gruffly said, "Move up ahead."

As they passed the line, a few of the people waiting took notice that they were being moved to the front of the line. A generalized groaning complaint issued from the crowd. The guard stationed at the gate stepped forward with their spears pointed out, shouting, "Stay in line, stay in line you lot."

Their escort led them through the small door cut into the large seemingly impregnable gate. He told them to stop and stepped towards a heavy door set in the side of the stone wall. He rapped his knuckles on a wooden door several times, "Wait here," the guard grumbled, and slipped back through the door to continue his surveillance of the crowd.. 

Finally, they heard the door creak open and a third guard walked out. He was wiping the messy remnant of an early dinner from this mouth and beard. His irritated expression suggested that he had not wanted to be disturbed. He waved Tara and her father to come follow him into the room after him.

They room was bare, just stone floor and walls, wooden beams running here and there for support. A wall of weapons and shields were lined up on one side. There was a cot opposite that. In the middle of the room was a long table littered with dirty dishes. There was also a tall wooden stand near the one window cut high into the stone walls. A large book lay open on the stand.

He reached out for the paper saying, "Let me see that paper you're carrying,"

Tara's father nervously moved forward, holding the invitation out, "It was just delivered earlier today. It's authentic."

"I'll be the judge of that, don't you doubt it." He walked over to the stand and the window. He held up the invitatino to the light and turned it over several times. He flipped back and forth in the book, looking for a specific page. With the page finally found, the lay the invitation next to it. 

Tara watched as he glanced back and forth between the page of the book on the left side and the invitation on the right side. He did this several times before removing the invitation and flipping around to find another page. Now he ran a finger up and down the page as if scanning for a specific piece of information. 

When the finger stopped scanning, he turned to Tara's father and said, "The invitation looks real enough, but I find no record of your visit in the log here."

Her father looked wild and desperate all of a sudden, "That cannot be. There must be a mistake. I was visited by a courier just this morning."

"Well the forgeries are getting better and better. It's a fine job whoever produced this."

Her father stood up tall, as if offended by the suggestion that this invitation was fake, "I would never. Do you know who I am? I served the king's father as the Chief Recorder for well over twenty years. I have continued to loyally serve our new ruler as well."

The guard scratched his beard, "That all might be so, or just a convincing cover story, but unless you're in the log, I'm not authorized to let you in."

Tara's father collapsed in a nearby chair and let out a pietous moan. She stepped forward, "Surely there must be some way to correct this mistake." She tried to think quickly, "Yestersday, we were visited by someone from the court. An older gentleman, dark suit, top hat." The guard eyed her suspicously. This new information signified something to him, but he wasn't revealing what just yet.

The guard opened the door and shouted up to one of the guards who was stationed above the gate, "Eh, you, I need you down here now."

Another door, opposite the one they had entered, and the guard appeared from the dark hall into the murky light in the room. The suprioer officers turned to him, "I need these two thoroughly inspected, no fold of fabric unturned, then take them to the palace entrance. They need further review and we're not equipped for that sort of thing here." The guard merely answered, "Yes sir," and began searching Tara and her father.

***

Their papers and selves were searched, inspected, scrutinized several more times before Tara and her father found herself waiting in a antechamber to the throne room. Guards stood at the door, stone faced and not acknowledging them. Tara could hear voices coming through the door and wondered what business the king was attending to at the moment. 

Whatever that business might be, it took some time to conduct. Whereas they started by standing in the antechamber, anticipating a quick entrance, after some time they were sitting on stone benches that protruded from the wall. Tara's father said quietly, "It was never like this before. This is outrageous treatment. I simply do not understand."

Tara did her best to pacify her father, especially after one of the guards looked askance at them. She thought it best to not attract any attention, especailly after the effort it took to reach this point in the palace. "Father, I'm sure there is a good reason for the procedures. Surely they subject every visitor to them. We've come this far. We just need to wait patiently."

"Yes,yes, you are right. So much time has passed. Perhaps I made a mistake being away from court for so long. I assumed that my status was secure given the improtance of my role. My dispatches were always received and replied to. I just wish I understood."

Tara had never heard her father talk about their distance from court as a decision he had made. When she was younger she took it as a fact that they lived in a remote place, far away from others. Her growing awareness when she was older that they enjoyed an elevated status also coincided with a growing awareness that her father's work was improtant, consuming. The work did not leave him time to host parties, to mingle with the local landlords, even to go into town that often.The house staff attended to his needs and he seemed contented to have those needs fulfilled by the people employed to do just that. But not all of the facts were, in fact, facts, but choices her father made about the shape his life, and in consequence, her life would take. 

She couldn't help but wonder, as they sat mere feet from the kingdom's seat of power, what had been denied to her due to their distance from that seat. What would life had been like if they had traveled regualrly to the capital, had been none to the greatest families in teh kingdom, not just the local gentry of their little corner of the world. 

She didn't have long to dwell on these possibilities once the door opened and the man who had visited them at the inn stepped into the breach, instructing them even as he turned back to the hall, "The king will see you now."

They passed through the doors and into a long narrow windows. Tall slender windows ran from floor to ceiling on either side of the hall. At the far end, raised on a dias, at the king, whispering into the ear of someone who stood beside him. 

At first glance, the king was nothing like what Tara had expected. He wasn't regal or kingly at all. He sat slouched in the throne, seemingly more engaged in the side conversation he was having than on the two visitors entering his throne room. His hair was disheveled, his clothes slovenly. He seemed bored, and perhaps even boring to Tara. To say she was disappoitned by this first introduction, would be an understatement.

They stopped where they were instructed to stop. At her father's nudging, Tara bowed alongside him and held the bow until the king acknowledge them. Unforutnately, the conversation took hold over the king again, and he continued talking and laughing instead of acknowledging them.

Tara started to roll her neck from side the side under the strain of holding this position for so long. Finally the older man, seemingly some kind of advisor, coughed and caught the king's attention. The king looked up at the them and said, "Yes, of course, who do we have here?"

The advisor stepped forward, "This is Mr. Arch and his daughter." Again following her father, she bowed lower, into more of a curtsey as Ms. Reedy had often shown her.

"Yes, and he is?" the king already seemed impatient with the proceedings. There were two attendants waiting off the side who had caught his attention. He seemingly was more interested in whatever messages they had to convey than his father.

Her father's pride got the better of them and he spoke up for himself, "Your highness, I am the Chief Recorder of the western lands. I served your father and was apprenticed during your grandmother's reign."

Tara could not tell if the king or the advisor was more annoyed by her father's self-assertion. The king looked over at the advisor and careless said, "Chief Recorder, I thought we were recalling those."

The advisor quickly responded, "It was the topic of a discussion. No action was decided. If you recall, your highness, the council had to adjourn rather suddenly."

"Ah yes, I vaguely recall there being a hunt to attend to." The king mused to himself, or to the room, or both, "I do love the distraction that a hunt provides. I am indiffernet to hunting, of course, but anything to relive the tedium of this position, I welcome. Even in my distraction I am a more effective ruler than my father, or so I am told. The kingdom was yearning for my rule. You might say it was my destiny to improve this kingdom, to make it great again."

The king went silent and in the pause, her father spoke up, "Your majesty I have come to you with urgent news and an even more urgent request."

The king waved his hand back and forth as if trying to swat the words. "Urgent! You speak to me of urgent. I deal in nothing but urgencies, all day. Few rulers have dealt with as many urgent matters as I seem to."

Again her father was struggling to muster the king's attention, "I have brought a reading from my vigilant, that I felt it necessary to review with you. And in light of that discussion hoped to make my request."

Unfortunately for her father, he had lost the king's attention again. The attendants who had been waiting were waved over. They began reviewing various documents they held with the king. The king was quickly nodding and glancing at the documents, approving and disapproving of things in rapid succession. When the attendants left, the king clapped his hands and stood, "I have grown tired of this audience. If you say you have matters to review and study, then give them to my man, Mr. Stewart. He will act in abstentia for me and convey to me what needs to be conveyed. In the meantime, I have to finalize the preparations for tonight's ball." Now, as if for the first time, he took notice of Tara. He looked back at her father as if somehow surpised that the two were conneted, "You should be sure to attend with your lovely daughter, Mr...."

"Arch, your majesty. Yes, we would be delighted to do that."

The advisor, Mr. Stewart, stepped forward to lead them out, "Very good, your majesty. I will provide them with the appropriate information."

Already distracted, the king replied, "Yes, see to it."

***

For Tara, everything that had been disappoitning and strange about their trip up till now ceased to exist for the rest of day. She was thrilled by the prospect of being able to attend a party, just as she had wanted hope to do when they visited.

Tara wasn't skilled at dressign herself in fine gowns, but she managed as best she could with some help from her father. She prepared her hair in a small, cloudy mirror that hung over the wash basin and wondered out loud what the party would be like. Her father did not add much to the conversation, but Tara didn't take much notice of the fact that he was not animated by the same excitement that she was. 

Finally the hour approached for the ball to start, so they made their way to palace. The streets were quieter during the day and Tara noticed that they were particularly quiet near the palace. Then she understood why. When she did catch sight of anythign moving in the streets, the movmeent was almost certainly soldiers, patrolling in groups or three of four. She also saw more soldiers stationed on the streets leading up to the palace. 

The motley line of people at the palace gates was now replaced by an orderly line of carriages. One by one the carriages were let into the palace grounds. Tara's father marveled over the scrutiny the guests were receiving. "In my time," he explained, "the gates were thrown open. People flowed in and out of them. I suppose that is not the way now."

Tara was only half listening to her father. She thought she caught of glimpse of the two soldiers that had harassesd her earlier, but she did not exert much effort in confirming this.

As they prepared to enter the palace for the second time today, Tara tried to rehearse all of the instructions that Ms. Reedy had given her to prepare her for this moment. She looked around, eyeing the rest of the crowd to determine who was attending this ball and how she should behave toward them. Unfortunatley for her, there was too many people to watch and track. She could not take it all in and started to feel overwhelmed as they entered.

When they were announcd at the door, a few curous heads turned then returned back to conversations. Together, they walked through the central entryway then up to the stairs to the ballroom on the next floor. When the they entered the ballroom, Tara was overwhelmed by how expansive it was and how full of people it was. The guests seemed too numerous to count. Tara tried study each face as they passed by people so that she could recall them later should the need arise. Quickly, she gave up on this. After that, she lost track of the faces, the dresses, and the chatter around them.

In the ballroom, Tara and her father attracted more attention. People seem to take particular notice of her dress. She felt that she received many nods of approval. These reactions eased her mind about fitting in and being accepted by the guests. She was more focused, however, on the large numbers of young people in attendnace--some a little younger than herself, most older. As the music and dancing began, there seemed to be a steady stream of dance partners for her, at least for a turn or two, before swirling off to engage in other pursuits.

Now that the evening's attention had been shifted to the dancing, guests crowded the edges of the ballroom, while the dance floor saw a steady flow of gowns and long tailed coats, feet tapping and scraping their way across the intricate patterns in even more intricate patterns of arched arms and sweeping legs. Half way through, Tara had to take a break. She was flushed and could feel sweat starting to roll down the angles of her shoulder blades. She sat and felt content and chatted merrily with the guests around her.

She knew that Ms. Reedy would have been very satisfied with her comportment and bearing. She was not so sure of her father; she saw him chatting in corner with several older gentlemen who did not seem particualry well-kept or highly regarded by the other guests. When they noticed her surveying them, each of the elderly gentlemen nodded approvingly in her direction. She felt a flush of embarassment at that moment and wondered why her father had attached himself to these people, of all the people in the room. She could only imagine the stories and memories they were sharing and reliving together amidst the whirl finery around them.

The musicians began to play again and dancers found partners and began to assemble on the dance floor. The tune and tempo dictating a line dance, with the dancers pairing up as they criss crossed the floor, then remerged back in to the line.

As the princess took her place in the line of other ladies dancing this round, she could hear the mood of the room shift. Somehow, all at once, everyone’s attention shifted to a new center of gravity. Tara looked around to understand what was distracting everyone from the dance floor, which normally was the center of attention for a ball. Then she realized what had happened. She realized the moment that she brought her own attention back to the lines before her and looked across to see a new dance partner standing across from her. She didn't know who the young man was, but he bore a striking resemblance to the king.

The tittering and talk in the room caused the musicians to stop their tunings momentarily. The young man, smiling generously at the all of the attention washing over him, gestured for the room to quiet down, which it did almost immediately. He nodded to the lead musician. The musicians harmonized their instruments and began to play. The music moved at a brisk pace. It had intricate timing, and sometimes the tempo would change suddenly, signaling a new formation or movement in the dance. Dancing in this way required the dancer’s complete concentration to fully appreciate the directions being give them.

The musicians were skilled enough to not just blindly lead the dancers along, but to respond to the dancers as well. A couple who seemed too attached might cause a rapid shift in the music to indicate that it was time to pair up again, or another pairing might catch and hold the room’s attention, causing the musicions to stretch out the theme a little longer.

Certainly, they responded to the moment when she finally crossed paths with the  young man The music seemed to change entirely, signaling that they would be dancing with these partners for a while. Indeed, every eye was on them as they held their dancing poses, bowing, dipping, and crossing each other in time with the music. The young man almost seemed indifferent to the fact that they were dancing together. But the music sped up again and they started to travel the dance floor at a steady trotting pace. The music slowed again with them in the center of the room.

When their dance ended, Tara found herself standing alone again on the dance floor. She looked around for the young man but he had disappeared in the crowd. She felt a momentary feeling of disappointing, perhaps hoping that they could have kept dancing all night together. But that was not meant to be.

The musicians were warming up to play again after a brief pause. Tara waited for the next round of dancing to begin. She look over and saw her father, sitting in a chair looking tired and bored. When he noticed her looking at him, he perked up momentarily and smiled. He didn't trick her for long and fell back into his slumped posture and slack looking face as soon as it seemed she was not lookign at him.

She went up to him and said, "Papa, dance with me, won't you?"

"Ah me? No this is sport for younger people than me," he replied.

"Please, papa. At least this once. It would make me so very happy."

Her father could not resist her entreaties for long. He finally stood up and followed her into the crowd of dancers. Just as they took up position in the line, the music started again. The music was slower paced this time, allowing the dancers to weave their lines in and out of each other at a pace her father easily maintain. Dancers would break off for several bars the the line would form again.

While she danced, Tara felt the happiest she could remember feeling in quite some time. Perhaps not since she was a little girl, with hardly a care or concern to bother her, or certainly no cares that could unsettle the self-centered contentment of a child in her circumstances. It might be fairly said that these were indeed, the happiest moments of her life.

The music stopped suddenly, putting an end to her reverie. The crowd let out a cry of confusion followed by the scuffing of feet as every one turned to search ouf the reason for the evening's entertainment being so ruedly interrupted. Fortunately for the guests, they were not kept in suspense for long. Unfortunatley for Tara dn her father they quickly discovered the reason for the music and dancing stopping so abruptly.

The discovery started with the feeling that people were beginngin to look at them, but not in they pleasant way that the people before had watched her dance. Instead of casting about for an explanation, it seemed like every head in the room began turning towards Tara and her father. A passageway opened in the crowd and coming towards her, Tara could see four soldiers and the king's advisor from earlier, Mr. Steweard walking towards them.

The guards stopped to form a square around them and began pushing back the people. A few brave souls cried out that this was an outrage and an abuse of the king's power. One particuarly vocal person was seized by a fifth guard and removed from the ballroom. Tara and her father stood alone now in the room, surrounded by soldiers and no one else.

With the guards in place, Mr. Stewart drew closer and held up a piece of paper. "A proclomation from the King," he announced, raising his voice to be heard over the ripple of chatter in the room. "Let it be known that from this day forward, Nolan Arch shall be considered a traitor to the king and the body politic of the kingdom. He is sentenced to imprisonment until his natural death. What is his is not the king's. His issue and heirs shall henceforth be stripped of any claim to preference or privilege."

Tara felt terrified as two of the guards approached them, seized her father. He crumpled in the guard's grip. Tara rushed forward trying to grab for the guards, pull them away from her father. She cried out, "There must be some mistake. This is a mistake..." The guard easily shrugged off her attempts to free her father. A third guard then grabbed her arm. They were, all of them, escorted from the palace with Mr. Stewart following closely behind them.

# Chapter 6 #

Tara could feel the man's eyes searching over her, looking for signs of inconsitency on her story. She kept her arms close and hands held tight to hide any threadbare patches in her clothes, to keep her rough hands out of site. "You can be puntunctual and do your duties quietly and as you're told?" he asked her finally.

"Yes, sir. I'm a hard worker. I'll do a good job." She tried to keep the desperation out of her voice and speak matter of factly. She had learned the lesson many times over that maintaining appearances mattered greatly.

The man, who had introduced himself as Mr. Mercer, leaned back in his chair. He looked at her again and a shrewed look came into his eyes, "I suppose you're from the prison, aren't you? Seems like everyone here is one way or another. Or if they weren't they were at some point." He paused, "Well?"

Tara didn't know how to respond. He was asking the question so matter of factly that she decided it was best to be truthful, "Yes, sir."

"Hard to imagine someone as young as you doing something the land there. What is it? A family member? Someone close to you?"

"My father, sir."

"The term?"

"Life. He's two years into his sentence. But I'm free to come and go. I have a letter here." She produced the letter from the prison's warden. She kept it close with her at all time, having heard stories that it could extricate her from difficult situations, but she kept it out of sight and carried it about like a mark of shame too. She had been told early on to only use it if absolutely needed. 

The man took the letter from her and lowered his glasses perched on his head to read it. "Well this all sounds very official."

"Sir, if I may?"

"Yes?"

"My father. He's taken ill and needs medicine and doctors. The prison will only do so much. So I was hoping to..."

The man cut her off, "To trick me into thinking you were a respectable house maid so that you could take your earnings to extend the life of an incarcerated criminal?" Tara's face must have expressed a mixture of rage and terror at the same time. The man interjected, "There's no need for that look. I'm a man of the world, a simple man, but a man of the world. I've seen much of how the world works, the parts it wants you to see and the parts it doesn't. If you're punctual and do your duty, you may have the job and use the earnings for whatever you wish. I suppose you can read. You speak like someone who can read."

Again, she hesitated to be too forthcoming, having learned early on that it was better to conceal any refinement, education. After their time in the prison, it hadn't been too hard. Much of the sheen of her past life had been rubbed away by worry and toil. "I can read." She paused then ventured, "And write as well." 

"Well your writing won't be of much help to me, but it's useful that you can read.." He dipped the tip of his pen in a small jar of ink and scribbled out several lines then handed her the paper. "That is your list of duties. I expect you to be here twice a week in the morning. I wake early and leave early. If you're not prompt, then you'll create confusion and delay and I won't like that. I will let you inside. If there are updated instructions, I will leave them written out. Understood?"

"Yes, I understand."

"Very well. Then you are hired. I will see you in two days times." 

"Very promptly and on time."

"I should hope so for your father's sake." 

She knew that she was supposed to turn to leave, but stood in place, trying to muster up the courage to ask for a small advance. Whether because he anticipated the question or was ready for her to leave, the man stood up and reached into a small pocket in his waistcoat and retrived a few coins to press into her hand. She felt a rush of gratitude and moved to say thank you, but he stopped her. "Consider this an advance against future earnings. You'll work for that, don't you forget."

He showed her to the door and promptly closed it behind her. Tara went downstairs and exited onto the dusty street. She stopped, looking around, and heard someone call out to her, "So, did you get the job?" A woman stepped out of the shadowy doorway where she had been waiting. Together they turned to walk down the plank sidewalks. The woman was several years older than Tara, but had been worn down much more by life. Her clothes were generally in worse condition. She had a slight crook in her neck and already wiry streaks of gray appeared in her hair.

Tara held out her first, clenched tighly around the coins. The weight of them in her hand felt strange, almost out of place, but that weight also brough a sense of comfort. She opened the fist and showed the woman the money. The woman spun around and clapped. "I knew you could do it!" She reached to pick one of the coins, a smaller rust colored one.

Tara drew back her hand, but the woman cried out, "I deserve a finder's fee. Seems only fair."

"Finder's fee for what?"

"For bringing you to this job?"

"You only told me about it after you applied yourself and were turned down."

"But I knew you'd be just the person. Fit the bill and all that, didn't you."

"I suppose."

The woman studied herself in plate of glass they were passing by, "Yes, old Maggie is just rag and bones already in my young age. You're still a proper city lady, ain't you"

"I'm not from the city, you know that."

"But you've got breeding. No use denying. Everyone can see it. From the first even."

"Maybe." 

"Be dear and give old Maggie a finder's fee." Maggie held our her hand and made a face like a child pleading for a treat. Tara felt amused by the caper and handed the small coin over. Maggie snatched the coin before it was taken away, kissed Tara on the cheek and said, "I'll see you back at the home."

Maggie, usually a spendthrift with any extra coin she came into contact with, skipped off to spend this particular coin somewhere. Tara had met Maggie not long after her relocation to the prison with her father, which Maggie liked to called their home. She had not liked Maggie at first, who teased her endlessly about her fine clothes and fine wares that she brough with with her.

"You packed for a holiday?" Maggie had said the first time she came into the two room cell that Tara shared with her father. She had not invited Maggie into their rooms, but the woman somehow insinutated herself inside without Tara realizing it. This, Tara came to realize, was Maggie's way. Maggie had a genius for getting things she wanted with the least amount of effort possible. 

After a few months, the over teasing gave way to a genial ribbing, and a ready reminder that, while Tara might consider herself of higher status, she was in the same situation as everyone else at the prison, with few prosepects of getting out or moving beyond it. Maggie, as Tara learned, had lived in the prison since she was nine or ten, having moved there when her mother was imprisoned. "After my dear old dad died, we learned he had left considerable debts on account of another life he lived in a nearby town. My mom had to take on his debts, then was jailed when she couldn't repay."

Maggie had grown into womanhood along with a younger brother and sister in the prison and knew its ways and the ways of the town well. Tara was a reluctant student at first, and didn't venture into town until 6 months or so had elapsed. Maggie chided her for staying copped up in her cell with her father or in the prison yard. "You're not the one serving the sentence, you know. You are allowed to leave. Go out, earn some coin. The warden don't mind a bit, it's less he has to provide for."

"They're not worried about the prisoners getting out?" Tara had asked, somewhat incredulous that the prison was so lax.

In response, Maggie had waved her arms around at the various cells. "Have you seen the broken up people in here? They were defeated the moment they sat foot in the prison walls, probably before that. These aren't scheming murders after all."

Maggie finally convincend, or compelled, Tara to venture into town with her. The town itself was small, though busy. It existed at a crossroad on a trade route, though most of the town existed to maintain the prison. It was less rustic and quaint that the country town she had grown up near, but not nearly as built up and bustling as the capital.

At the time, Maggie was wide eyed when Tara told her that she had visited the capital and even been inside the palace. She liked to hear Tara tell stories about the people and buildings, the fine clothes and the dashing soldiers. Over the last few years, Tara had repeated the stories countless times. Each time she tried to mine some new detail or fact from her memory to delight Maggie. It is possible that Tara had exaggerated a few details or inserted a few imaginative alterations to her story. She she had done so in such a convincing manner that she could no longer see the seams where the true story had been stitched to the invented one.

With money in her hands now, Tara made her way to the apothecary's shop to purchase the medicine that the doctor insisted that her father needed. When she finally made her way inside the shop, the old man sitting at the counter creaked up on his feet to read from the script that the doctor had given her.

The apothecary read the list and shook his head. He looked up at her with a puzzled look, "These can't be for you? You're the very image of health, as far as I can see."

"No, sir. I'm sorry I wasn't more clear. This is for my father."

"Ah, I see. Yes, well that makes more sense."

The apothecary didn't move immediately to provide her with the requested medicince, leavign her confused. She hesitatingly asked, "Is something wrong?"

The odl man shook his head again, "No, no nothing wrong. I'm just surprised that's all."

"Surpised by what?"

"Well, if I may put this delicately, surpsrised that you are not more upset right now."

"I'm upset that my father is sick. I've had to work hard to secure funds for the medicine and future visits from the doctor."

"Yes, perhaps so, but I'm afraid based on these medicine that your father is beyind being sick."

"I don't understand."

"Unless I am missing some vital piece of information, your father is dying, young woman."

Tara took a step back, feeling like her breath had been taken from her. "Dying? You must be mistaken. The doctor said nothing..." But she could see in the old man's sad eyes that he was speaking the truth and that the doctor had not lied, to her, but had told the truth in such a way that bad parts were harder to get a hold of and handle. "Won't these medicine make him better?"

The apothocary looked at the script again, "I'm afraid not, these are just to provide comfort and nothing more. Do you still want me to fill them?"

Tara nodded her head and waited while the apothecary prepared the medicine. He passed them to her wrapped in brown paper. She held out her coins to pay and the old man refused to take them. "Hold on to your money this time. If you see me again, we can discuss payment."

***

Tara opened to the door to the cell she shared with her father and crept inside. A curtain separated the front room from the back room where her father slept. She pulled the curtain aside to peek in and saw that her father was asleep already. He spent much of this time this way, or sitting in the front room in a ragged chair by the coal stove that eeked out what little heat it was capable of producing. She unwrapped the medicine and measured out the dosage. It took several tries to stir her father from sleep. She helped prop him up in his weary state and coaxed the bitter smelling medicine down him. After making him more comfortable, she went back into the front room to tidy up. 

The room was cold and she didn't feel tired so she added another lump of coal to the stove. They only had a small pile in the bucket to see them through the next week until their allotment was refilled. She made a weak cup of tea from the tepid water that was still sitting in the kettle and resused the tea that her father had used earlier in the day. 

She sat in another, smaller hard wooden chair near her father's worn down one and lit a candle. They had consolidated their belonging down to one trunk, having sold off most of their possessions over the last few years. Kettles and blankets and candles and other necessities didn't just appear out of no where. In fact Tara's first words upon entering the cell for the first time ahd been, "It's empty!? Where is everything?"

The warden had turned to her and smiled a ghastly smile, "You scrounge and scour young lady. Everything is scrounging and scouring." So she had adapted to the scrounging and scouring, also the reusing and repurposing. She realized early on that her father would not be able to adapt to these new circumstances so she took it upon herself to be the one that ensured their survival. 

She managed to hold on to a few of their posessions, and as much clothing as she possibly could. She learned early on that her sewing skills were barely adequate to keep their clothing mending, but not much else. It was too costly to pay another prison resident to do this for them. So, the lone trunk still had a few articles of clothing, but also the few books she held on to. The writing materials had long since disappeared.

These books had been comforting companions these last few years, but like any company she sometimes could only wearlily accept that they retold the same tales. She had tried to see if any other prison residents would swap books. There was only one other resident with a few books, an old scholar, but his books were in another language and largely dealt with philosophical questions that didn't interest Tara.

She only allowed herself a small bit of candle each night for reading. She even went so far as the mark up the candles with a knife to keep track. Once her segement was over, she was done reading for the night. This night was no different. She read for her alloted amount of light for the night then prepared her cot for sleep.

***

In the morning, a stacatto knock on the door alerted Tara to the fact that Maggie was wanted her for some reason or another. She was getting her father situated in his chair, making his tea and preparing his breakfast. Fortunatley, her father had always eaten simple, small meals. So he was able to subsist on porridge, thin stews, and whatever else Tara could conjure up for them.

"Someone knocking, Tara." Her father said. "Aren't you going to answer it?"

"Yes, father, just a moment. Here is your tea," she said, placing the chipped cup on the wobbling table near him. The knocking continued.

"Please Tara, the knocking is agitating my nerves."

"It's only Maggie, father." Her father frowned. He had expressed on many occassions that he did not think Maggie was an appropriate acquaintance for Tara. She tried to explain in as gentle of a way that she could that their circumstances were different and that they were no better than someone like Maggie now. But her father did not like hearing this and every time Maggie's name was mentioned he reacted as if their respectability was being eroded a little bit more each time. Tara knew now that what little respectablity they had had been blasted away when they were seized by the king's guard at the palace and escorted out.

Tara did not want to agigate her father further, so she wiped her hands on her apron and wiped her hair back form her face. Her father liked the room to be warm and rushing about performing her duties always brought a hot flush to her face. She made for the door and opened it ajar. As expected, there was Maggie's bright eyes and crooked smile looking back at her. 

Maggie stood on her tiptoes and made to wave at Tara's father. He did not take any notice of her. Tara waved her hands down and stepped outside and closed the door. "Are you trying to make life complicated for me?"

"I was just being friendly, dear friend." Tara frowned, "Don't be cross with me."

"I'm not cross; I'm just tired." Tara weighed whether or not to tell Maggie about her father but decided to keep that to herself for now. She didn't want news spreading through the prison that her father was gravely ill. It seeemed like every resident had some ailment, whether real or imagined. Many would discourse on these ailments for as long as the listener was willing to listen.

"Did you get the medicine for your father?" Maggie asked.

Tara answered evasively, "Yes. I was able to."

"Thanks to Maggie, of course. Always looking out for me and mine."

"That's true." Tara smiled, but wondered why Maggie had appeared so early at her door.

"I learned a piece of news that you might be interested in."

"What's that?"

"A new guest will be staying with us in the old home."

"And from what I gather he might be an acquaintence of your fathers."

Tara didn't think of her father having any acquaintances and couldn't think who it might be. She tried to summon a catalog of names and faces, but nothing appeared in the ledger. She stuttered out, "I don't understand. I don't know who it could be."

Maggie leaned in closer to speak in a conspiratorial tone, "Well, I know. I know more about you than you might think."

"Like what?"

"Well like your father was a recorder that he was arrested for treason."

Tara had never shared these details with anyone and didn't know how Maggie knew this. She had decided that the fewer details she shared with people the better.

"How do you know this?"

"Word gets around. Don't worry, I don't think any less of you."

"But people know."

Maggie looked a little guitly as she replied, "Well some people."

Tara shook her head, "It doesn't matter now. But why are you telling me?" New arrivals at the prison always sparked curiostiry and interest, not to mention raised the possibilty of bartering for new things. It was probably also the case that the long term inmates sensed an opportunity to take advantage of new occupants and their inexperience with the intricacies of living in the prison.

Maggie shrugged, "Dunno. Thought the connection might mean a little extra at the trade."

"And a finder's fee?"

Maggie feigned outrage and slapped at Tara's arm, "You nasty thing. Don't be unfair."

Tara smiled back and replied, "That's fine. I need to get back to my father."

"If you do call on the new resident, be sure to tell me all of the details," Maggie said.

"I will," Tara replied, knowing that she would keep some details to herself should the visit happen.

# Chapter 7 #

Her father refused to call on the new resident at first. He didn't even want to talk to her about it and claimed that his headache had gotten much worse as a result. He retreated into the dim light of his back room, leaving her alone. An hour later he reemrged and asked for his hat and cane.

The new resident was situated in the opposite side of the prison on one of the upper levels. They had to cross the yard and ascend several flights of stairs. Her father moved very slowly now. Tara had to patiently walk alongside her father as he made deliberate step after deliberate step.

A few of the prisoners in the yard tipped their heads to Tara and her father, but most ignored them. A crowd of children were playing whack the rat, but froze in their tracks when the rat ran in front of Tara and her father. Tara had always assumed that the reticence, even fear, that people in the prison expressed towards them had to do with the fact that they seemed to give airs and maybe had powerful conenctions.

She realized now that it was likely due to the rumors about her father being a recorder. Maybe these people worried that her father held some memory of them, or could see through them. She had heard people say these things about recorders and vigilants in the abstract, but had never connected these superstitions to her father.

At this moment, Tara knew that all of her father's concentration was aimed at their walk, keeping himself upright and moving forward. Besides with the terrible headaches he complained of more and more regularly he could rarely think clearly or recall much of anything, must less obscure scenes of faces from the prison yard. But Tara learned more and more how fear of things seen and unseen, real and imagined, movtivated so much of what happened in the world. How whispered stories could animate people to act in ways they never would have without the stories. 

They finally reached the new resident's door. Tara knocked for her father, knocked several times, before a gruff voice yelled out, "Go away, I've got nothing to barter."

"We're not here to barter," Tara replied meekly.

"Well go away. Leave me alone."

Tara's father looked up at hearing the voice and called out, "Schiller is that you?"

Silence from the cell and then the voice sounded nearer, "Arch is that you?"

"Yes, it is."

The cell door opened and Tara saw a wizened old man, older than her father, with bleary eyes and long beard standing before them. He was equally as frail looking as her father and seemed to quiver as the cold winter air blew across him. The man looked almost conspiratorial and waved them in to his cell, "Come in, quickly, come in."

They both entered the cell, smaller than their own, being only one room, but made from the same roughly hewn stone. The floor was worn smooth from previous occupants' pacing. The room only had a bed and one chair. Tara noticed a small traveling case by the bed, but no other personal items.

With the door shut behind them, the old man, Schiller, motioned them to sit on the bed, while he perched on the edge of the chair. Even though he was older than her father, the man seemed to burst with nervous energy. He ran his hand constantly through his beard. He picked at this finger nails and nervously ran his hands up and down the front of his shirt. "I heard a rumor that you had been imprisoned."

"Yes," her father replied, "Nearly two years ago. What are the odd we end up in teh same place."

The old man scoffed, "Well the prisons are filling up and I never considered the current regime to be overly concerned with the particulars of things."

Her father sighed, "Yes, I suppose it's just dumb luck then."

"Certainly dumb, questionable luck."

As if remembering that she was there, her father turned to Tara and introduced her. "This is my daughter, Tara."

"I decduced as much. How do you do?" the old man asked absently, not keenly listening for her reply.

Nevertheless she politely respodned, "I am well, thank you."

He turned to her father again, "So, nearly two years on and you're still here."

"No one has told me otherwise. But I am more eager to know why you are here."

"I ran afoul of the Inspector General and my protests to the king went unheard."

"Inpector General?"

"Yes, he oversees the recorders adn vigilants now. Makes the final determination about the archive."

"The recorders no longer decide?"

"No, been that way for a while now. Perhaps not long after your disapperance."

"I see," her father replied.

Tara was puzzled by this discussion so interjected into it, "I don't understand. Why would this Inspector General be a problem?"

The old man said, "The recorders were never intended to work that way. Each recorder reviewed the record, decided upon its final contents, and verified it. This was meant to ensure greater accuracy and veracity."

"Veracity, how?"

"Because conflicting versions of events would be allowed in the official record. If two recorders saw similar events from a different perspective then it would be allow to stand. And that law was iviolable for generations until now."

"So the Inpsector General is the one who decides now?" she asked.

"Or whomever he reports to or whomever that person reports to."

"Ultimatley the king," her father chimed in. "The king is the one who decides now."

Mr. Schiller scoffed at this comment, "More likely than not his advisor. The king hardly does anythign without the input of his advisor."

"We know him well," her father replied. He refocused on Mr. Schiller, "Do you know if you have been replaced?"

"I am uncertain, though I doubt it. They have been consolidating regions, whittling down the number of recorders."

"How many are there?" Tara asked. She had always heard that there might be other recorders across the kingdom, but her father never volunteered any information abou them. It was interesting to her to speak direclty with someone who knew her father's world but was more forthcoming about it.

"We never really knew," Schiller responded. "Likely five or six. But who can say?"

As Tara thought more about what this consolidation might mean, her thoughts led her Avalon. She thought about Avalon from time to time, but always in relationship to herself. She missed Avalon, missed having her in her household, considering her a part of her life. She had not thought about Avalon's role as vigilant and what had happened to that role after her and her father's imprisonment.

Tara looked over at her father who seemed to understand the thoughts reeling through her mind. He shrugged and said, "I do not know."

"Know what?" Schiller asked.

"About my vigilant. What happened to her as a result of my...situation?"

<!-- need to fact check this next assertion against earlier scenes -->
Even after two years, her father refused to call his imprisonment anything besides his "situtation," assuming he referred to it at all. 

Schiller shruggedl and said, "I never heard anything. Who knows. Vigilants have such short lives as it is."

Tara cried out, "Oh Avalon. I hope she's okay?"

Schiller seemed puzzled, "Avalon?" He paused then added, "You gave your vigilant a name?"

Tara looked at her father again who became very uncomfortable. He looked down and spoke softly, "Tara became so attached to her. I didn't see the harm at the time."

"Harm? No harm in up ending the order of things? What harm might there be in that?"

Tara lashed out in response, "What good has the order of things done us. Look at where we are now."

"Well young lady, perhaps there is a connection between the two. Have you considered that?"

Her father let out a plantive moan, clutched his head, and started swaying back and forth. "Oh father. He has become so senstiive to least agigtation."

Schiller set on the bed next to him, "Is it the headaches?" Her father nodded, "I've lived with the headaches so long I don't recall a time before them."

Tara added, "They are much, much worse now."

The old man looked at her with a look of grave concern. "Has he seen a doctor?"

Tara wanted to resist this line of questioning so merely said, "Yes very recently."

"I see," was Schiller's blunt reply.

The onset of her father's headache brought their visit to a quick end. Tara led him back to the cell and made him as comfortable as she could while she prepared his medicine. Just as the apothocary said, the medicine seemed to tame the headache and make her father comfortable enough to sleep.

Tara spent the rest of the day finishing chores, reading, and preparing for her first day of work in the morning. All the while she thought about Avalon and where she might be. She had trouble imagining her anywhere but at the old cottage, a place that Tara had tried to blot out from memory as much as she could. It was too painful to recall the trimmed gardens, the wild forest. The worn homey feel of the bannister, the look of light shining across the floors. 

She knew so little of the world that she could only imagine Avalon in that home, a place where it seemed she wasn't even supposed to have been, with a name she wasn't supposed to have had. Did she have another name, Tara wondered? Or had they somehow come to know her name and once it was known, it could not be unknown. 

The fire had nearly burned down. Tara stoked it one more time, but there was little heat left to give. She smothered the fire and closed the grate to avoid letting in cold air. She wrapped herself up in a threadworn blanket and wondered if she would ever see Avalon again.

###

Tara left the prison as soon as the gates opened in the morning. Winter was setting in and a cold wind blew across the lake that separated the prison from the town. She tried to stay huddled in her shawl to keep in what warmth she could as she crossed the long causeway. She finally reached the gate house at the end of the causeway, nodded to the morning guard, and walked the rest of the way into town.

Just as he had said, Mr. Mercer was waiting to let her in and leave for his daily business. She set to work cleaning the rooms of his apartment, scooping up old ash, scrubbing the cast iron grates. She dusted and mopped and wiped and arranged until it was time to leave.

The man seemed satisfied with her work after the first week and promptly paid her, minus the advance of course. He was never paritclarly friendly or particularly rude to her, especially at the end of the day when he would nod over the state of his quarters and say good night to her. In fact, he often seemed preoccupied, in another place altogether when he returned at the end of the day. Tara wondered what the man did as his occupation. He never mentioned anything about it to her.

At the end of the first month workign for him, Tara used a bit of the payment to buy herself a hot cup of tea in one of the tea shops in the working district of the town. The tea wasn't particularly strong and the food of middling quality, but when she could, she enjoyed sitting at the window and watching people in the streets pass by. 

Tara held her hands over the steaming tea, looking out of the windows that were steaming up from the people in close quarters. She started to sip from the chipped up cup when she saw Mr. Mercer pass in front of the tea shop. She watched him, more out of curiousity than anything. In their brief meetings, he said nothing about what he filled his days doing. Whatever he did, though, he was punctual about it and seemed to take it very seriously. So in the spirit of idle curiosity, as she sipped and enjoyed her tea, in this brief moment of indulgence amidst everything, she trained her eyes on him to see where he was going. 

With his back to her, he crossed the street, disappearing behind a wagon laden with hay then reappearing on the opposite side of the street. He stopped and stood in place for several minutes before he started to look around furtively. He entered the building where he waited and disappeared in dark doorway.

Tara's eyes wandered up the side of the building along the zigzag of window frames. Most of the windows were covered in curtains or too dirty to see through. She noticed one where the curtain was parted by just a sliver. In that sliver she could just make out the sharp edge of a woman's face. The face, even from this distance, seemed strangely familiar. 

The woman in the window looked around the street, then the curtain closed. Tara wondered if she was imagining what she just saw. How was it possible? She had been under such strain with her father's worsening condition and the odd jobs she did to try to have enough money to keep him comfortable. Perhaps she was tired. Maybe something she ate had spoiled and was giving her visions.

She looked up again and noticed that the curtains had parted again. Only this time the face was Mr. Mercer. He looked down each side of the street and then looked down at her. Tara wasn't sure, but she felt like he was making eye contact with her. The curtain closed again. 

Tara hurried to finish her tea and set back to the prison before it got much later. Walking down the narrow dusty roads then back to the prison, she wondered how it was that she just saw Avalon's face in a window being called on by Mr. Mercer.

###

Mr. Mercer's attitude towards did not change at all the next time she saw him. She even worried that she might be fired. Nothing in his movements, his eyes, his voice betrayed any recollection of what had happened a few days past. He opened his apartment for her and disappeared to go about his business.

Before he could get too far, Tara rushed back down stairs. A boy was loafing on the opposite side of the street. She waved him over and asked him, "Can you do something for me for a coin?"

The boy looked at her shrewdly, like a merchant weighing the opportunity. "What kind of job?"

"Do you see that man making his way down the street?"

"Yeah, sure."

"I want you to follow him and tell me where he goes. I'll be back here in two days time and you can tell me everything you see. Do you agree?"

"I'll need more payment for a full report and advance in case I get parched and need refreshment."

Mr. Mercer was about to disappear in the distance so Tara agreed and handed over one coin to the boy. He raced off down the street. He managed to catch up with him remarkably fast then the two disappeared into crowd altogether.

When the time came for the report, Tara was disappointed to learn that Mr. Mercer's daily activities were not very interested. The boy told her that this had not been as nearly as exciting of a task as he had hoped. "I mostly stood about all day waiting for him to come and go," the boy explained.

"What about the tea shop, the one in the working district, do you know it?"

The boy searched his memory, "I think so."

"Did he stop anywhere in that area."

Again more searching, "No, not that I recall. He mostly went in and out the exhange, counting houses, and the like. Boring business if I made a guess. What's it matter to you anyways?"

Tara gave him a stern look, "That is my concern. You have done that I asked, so here is your final payment." It pained her somewhat to hand over the coin to the boy, but the boy'd jaded eyes grew big and he swelled with excitement when he saw it. She couldn't deny it to him now. Before he ran off, she laid a hand on his shoulder, "Remember this is just a game we were playing."

The boy looked at the hand then up and her, "I would hardly recognize you was anyone to ask." Then he ran off and disappeared down a alley.

# Chapter 8 #

<!-- tara's father dies; she decides to visit Avalon for herself;  -->

Even though the boy's report had been disappointing and contained no revealing information, Tara could not let go of the idea that her employer had some unexpected connection to Avalon. Every idle moment became devoted to speculating what this connection might be. She ran through theory after theory, each one more outlandish than the next.

She started following Mr. Mercer when she had the free time to do so. She learned how to keep her distance and stay discrete. She kept to the shadowy corners and thresholds of buildings. She slipping in and out from behind people in the crowd. No matter how diligent she was, though, she could not catch him going anywhere out of the ordinary, much less to the apartment that she assumed was Avalon's.

Late one afternoon when Tara was in midst of her reconnaissance when she thought she heard her name in the street. She turned but did not see anyone. Then she heard it again followed by Maggie running up the street neary out of breath. 

"Maggie?" Tara said, "What's wrong?" As soon as Maggie came to a standstill, Tara could see in her face that something had happened, that Maggie came bearing bad news. "No, it can't be?"

"I've been looking all over to find you to tell you." Maggie looked around at the warehouses that surrounded them, "What are you doing here? It doesn't matter. You must come back now."

"Is he?"

Maggie shook her head, "No, not yet, but he's close. The warden is drawing up his documents now." 

They both rushed back to the prison. A light rain made the bridge slick. Tara nearly fell twice in the rush and rustle of her dress. Maggie picked her up and they kept on across the water to the prison gates. The guard flung open the gate when he saw them approaching, even managed to give Tara a passing kindly look. She didn't have time to dwell on the changed posture and attitude of everyone around her. From the prison staff to the other residents, everyone seemed to be expressing the same temporary feeling of sympathy for her and her father. 

She rushed into the cell only to find the Warden and the prison's contracted doctor were there. The warden was looking around the cell, seeminly making an inventory of their beloingings. The doctor was sitting in a chair writing a report. Tara could see a still figure shrouded in a blanket laying in bed. "No!" she cried out, rushing to her father. She fell on her knees by the bed and laid her head down, "No, papa. Papa, please come back."

The doctor stood at the door, "I'm sorry. He had passed when I came in. There was nothing to do. He was very ill."

"I wasn't here. If only I had been here."

The doctor replied, "There was nothing you could have done."

"But he was alone, all alone."

"And so we all are the end," the doctor said.

The warden called the doctor aside. They whispered over some matter while Tara sat back down in a chair next to her father bed. She wiped the tears from her eyes and said, "Poor, papa. I'm sorry I wasn't here."

The doctor reappeared in the room and took the most tender tone imaginable, "Tara, I'm afraid that the warden needs to speak with you on a most delicate subject. I'm sorry it has to be this way, but it has to be this way."

Tara nodded and stood up. She nearly collapsed back down in grief, but some inner resolve straightened her out and she entered the front room.

The warden, who not a kind man, but particulary unkind either, set about explaining to her in a very distant tone that they would need to make arrangements to relocate Tara by the end of the day.

Tara looked at them both blankly. The doctor interceded, "Prison rules do not allow families to stay past the expiration of their incarcerated family member. In my experience, there are no exceptions."

The warden shook his head to emphasize that there were no exception, perhaps even with a hint of pride at the way the protocols had been so rigously maintained and enforced. "It's better for all if there is a clean break," the warden added.

"Better? How?" Tara asked.

"These situations can be very upsetting to the other inmates. They can lead to unrest and disorder. To say nothing of the fact that we don't resources to be a lodging house."

The doctor stepped in again, "The good news is that your father's sentence did not extend to you. I've reviewed the order and can confirm this. You can't hold lands and other privileges, but you are not required to serve out his term."

"That can happen."

The doctor said that he had seen cases of this. "It's very sad, a very sad situation. But you are free now."

"Free?"

"Free to go. Free to live your life."

"But where will I go? What will I do?" she said with a mixture of grief and panic.

The doctor seemed embarassed by her rising emotion. He stumbled over his words, "I don't...I can't say for sure. But at least you can determine that now."

As she stood there stunned in silence, two orderlies from the prison appeared to remove the body. "He'll be buried in the prison cemetary," the warden said. "Prisoners only get initials and dates on their headstone." Tara didn't respond to this information and watched as her father was removed. 

Finally the warden and the doctor finished their paperwork and left the room. As the doctor left he spoke a few final words, in a kind tone, "The warden will send guards around later to check the cell. I suggest you not be here at that time. I've witnessed very unfortuante scenes when an inmate's family refused to vacate."

Tara flatly replied, "I will be gone."

###

Tara finally resolved herself to gather up her things to leave the cell. She packed up a few articles of clothing and a few things that belonged to her father. She decided to keep one book and leave everythign else. She started out and crossed the prison yard. Before she reached the gate, Maggie caught up with her.

"Tara!? Where are you going?"

"I'm leaving."

"But to where?"

"I don't know yet, but I must leave. I've been told to leave."

"Stay with me, I'm sure you can."

"But the warden..."

"Let me handle the warden. I know how to bend him and his rules to what I want."

"No, I think I should leave. I think it would be better for me to leave."

As they spoke, the bell began to ring out announcing that the gates would close and that cells locked. Tara was surpsied that Maggie began to cry as they stood there. She didn't think that she really meant anything to Maggie, not anything meaningful. Perhaps Maggie was crying more for herself than for Tara. Not that the difference really mattered in this moment.

Maggie held back her tears and said, "Then I guess this is it. I guess you'll be off and I'll be here."

"I guess so. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. I don't know why I'm crying. You're not the first to leave. I don't know why I'm feeling this way." Tara didn't know what to say, so she jsut looked back at Maggie. Maggie moved towards her and wrapped her up in a hug. "Take care of yourself out there. Most of the world ain't like our little prison town."

"I know, thank you." Tara replied.

"But at least Maggie taught you to look out for yourself a little better."

Tara realized that this was true. Maggie had opened her eyes to how the world worked and made her a little better equiped to survive in it. "Yes you did and I'll never forget you for it."

One of the prison guard lumbered towards them, "Gates closing soon," he said gruffly. Tara realized that the ringing bells had become more emphatic. "Come on now," the guard said. 

Tara gave Maggie one more hug and slipped through what remained of the gap in teh gate. The lamps on the bridge were being extinguished as Tara crossed. She looked back and could only make out the glow of small fires in the prison windows. Otherwise, it was a hulking shadow in the night that she hoped to never see again.

She walked the darkened streets of the town wondering where to go. Without fully being aware of it, she found herself standing in the street where she had seen Avalon. She looked up at the window, noticing that it was dark. What if Avalon had left already.

A woman was leaving the tea shop across the street and locking the door. She walked up to her in a soft voice, "I'm sorry but the tea shop is closed."

"What's that?" Tara looked over the woman's shoulder at the tea shop's dark windows. 

"The shop is closed. I recognized you from the shop. I thought maybe you were wanting a cup of tea."

"No, thank you."

The woman started to back away from Tara, who could not help but speak in a dazed, far away voice. "Well, in that case, have a good night..."

Tara called out ot her, "Wait, do you know who lives there?" She pointed up at the windows she assumed were Avalon's.

"I don't know this neighborhood too well. I live on the other side of town. Let me think" The woman studied the window. "I think I recall a woman moving in there several months ago. She came into the shop once, but never again. Hardly ever leaves. I think I saw her in the street with a man once, but they didn't seem particularly acquainted with each other, if you take me meaning."

Tara thanked her and said goodnight. The woman did the same and started home. This information did not prove that Avalon lived here, but it strengthed Tara's resolve to find out. She entered the building's dark inner hallway and started up the dimly lit staircases. Single lamps lit each landing as Tara went up several flights. She thought back to her memory of seeing Avalon and thought that she lived at least three floors up. 

At the top of the third floor landing, she stood in a long narrow hallway. Door punctuated the hallway on each side. She could here the rumble and murmur of people all around her. Sounds and smells of cooking mingled with coal fire smoke in the hall. She oriented herself towards the street and counted down doors until she saw one that must be Avalons.

She approached the door and stood in front of it for several minutes before knocking. She felt a wave of exhaustion come over her and wanted to crumple on to the floor right there and sleep. Instead, she knew that she had to exert the energy and will to knock on the door and confront the reality that the person inside may be Avalon. The mere thought that it mgith not be here was enough to crush her to go through with this altogether. But she knew she had few options, so exhausting this one made as much sense as anything else.

She knocked on the door and waited. No answer came so she knocked again. And a few more times after that. Finally she could hear feet and rustling behind the door. More silence then the door opened.

On the other side of the door was a face that Tara recognized, but didn't recognize at the same time. It was like the face she saw in the window, only that face had more closely resembled Avalon's face. At least the piece of it she had seen at a distance matched her memory mroe closely than this one did up close. 

The face flashed a look of recognition, then responded with a quizzical sounding, "Tara? What are you doing here?" Avalon poked her head into the hallway perhaps to see if Tara was with anyone, or to see if anyone else was waiting for her in the hall. When she saw that the hall was empty, she pulled Tara inside saying, "Get in quickly before anyone see us."

She shut the door behind Tara and led her to ragged lounging chair position by the window. The room was mostly bare except for a stove, wash basin, and a table. In many ways it reminded Tara of her father's cell. The only real difference being that Avalon was in this room and not the other.

She sat Tara down on the chair and poured a glass of water from a pitcher on the table. Tara took it in her hand without thinking and drank it. She handed it back to Avalon and smiled a weak smile and said, "Avalon, you're here."

"Yes, I am just barely but I am here. And so are you. I know why and how I am here, but I am baffled by your being here. How did you find me?"

Tara did her best to recount what had happened since their arrival in the prison. Several times Avalon had to guide Tara's narration back to the more recent future. "I'm sorry to hear about your father. He was a good recorder, the only one I ever knew, but a good one nonethless. I knew that your father had been arrested, but could never find out where you had been taken. I must be honest that I had forgotten that there was a prison here until recently."

"What about you?" Tara asked in her weak, tired voice.

"It's a long story, much of it does not bear repeating. I will fill in details when I can. For now I will only tell you that I found myself in trouble and with few options for removing myself from that trouble. I recalled a merchant, your Mr. Mercer, that I had run across once in my travels. I was lucky enough to find him and he brought me here."

"And know you're here."

"For now?"

"Only for now? When are you leaving?"

"I don't know yet, he only tells me that the time isn't right yet. He has needed time to prepare everything."

A dark look came across Tara's face, "Do you think he plans to betray you?"

Avalon shook her head and said, "No, I do not think so. I have my reasons to trust him as I do; I can't get into those reasons now, but I believe him. He has taken great risks, though he often reminds me, to provide me with the room and to keep my supplied." Avalong seemed to notice that Tara was falling asleep in the midst of their conversation. She continedu on, "But you look exhausted; you must be exhausted. You must rest and we can talk more in the morning." 

Avalon guided Tara down ont the lounge chair and covered her in a blanket. She took more blankets and spread them on the floor. Tara's eyes fluttered open and close. She could feel herself slipping in and out of being awake and being asleep. She hardly noticed Avalon stretched out on the floor below her, but tiredly said, "Good Avalon, I'm glad you're returned."

Avalon shifted on her side towards Tara and said, "Yes, I think I am too."

###

<!--By the time Tara remembered that she was supposed to be at Mr. Mercer's apartment to clean, it was far too late to make her way there. The damage had been done and she would have to live with the consequences. From the the bits of information she picked up from Avalon in the morning, it might not matter anyway since Avalon planned to move to a new location sooner rather than later.

Tara spent another hour slipping in and out of sleep. The room had grown bright, almost hot, by the time she was able to rouse herself completely from her tried state. Avalon sat in a wooden chair opposite her reading. Tara saw a stack of books beside the chair. This at least answered one question she had had. What did Avalon do all day in this small one-room apartment?

Certainly from the hints Avalon dropped or outright explained she didn't leave the apartment very often, only when absolutely necssary. Instead Mr. Mercer ssaw to it that she has what she need to survive. So, apparently she read books and waiting and sometimes peeked out at the street and watched people in the town go by.

"Did you ever see me?" Tara asked, thinking in advance how odd it would have been if they had both seen each other, or least someone who resembled them.

Avalon merely replied, "No I never did. It is funny to think that you were only hundreds of feet away from me and neither of us realized it."-->

Tara woke up in the morning in a start. She was supposed to work for Mr. Mercer today. She flung back the blanket and jumped up from the chair. She splashed cold water on her face and rushed out of the door before Avalon could say anything.

Being in town already, it did not take her long to reach Mr. Mercer's apartment, but she was still running very, very late. As she expected, he was waiting in the street pacing and and impatient. When he saw her, he said gruffly, "You're late. I was about to leave and terminate your employment."

"I'm very sorry, I had to move last night and everything is just so..." Tara did not want to let lose her grief right now. Then she blurted out, "My father died yesterday."

Mr. Mercer's face lost its hard edge and he replied simply, "I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be about my business. Just go up and get started on your tasks."

Once in his apartment, she started in on her tasks, losing herself in the repitition of scrubbing and scouring and sweeping. She hardly thought about her father and the scenes from yesterday. Instead she focused her attention on the grains of wood in the floor, the glint of light on the brass fixtures she polished. 

After several hours, she had almost completed her list of tasks. She was changing the linens on the bed when the door burst open. Mr. Mercer entered the apartment out of breath, caught up in some excitement or frenzy. He stopped and looked around the apartment. When he spotted her, he said, "You're in danger and need to come with me. Nevermind the bed, come on now." He went over to standing closet and rifled through it pulled out a large shawl. He tossed it to her and said, "Take this and drape it over yourself. We must avoid being seen"

She followed him wordlessly, not fully understanding what threat might be out there but somehow trusting him that she was, in fact, in danger. At the bottom of the stairs, just before the street he stopped her and said. "I'm going out first. Count to twenty then you follow me. Keep your distance. Don't look like you're following me, but keep me in your sight. Keep your head down and look like you know where you are going. Do you understand?"

Tara replied, "Yes, but what's..."

"No time for that now. You need to trust me and do as I say."

Once  she walked out in to the street, she had a better sense of what might be going on, though no understanding of the cause. Soldiers seemed to be everywhere, as if they sprung up from the ground overnight. She also recognized some of the prison guards walking with the soldiers. They were patrolling, looking into stalls, stopping people in the streets. 

Up ahead, Tara saw Mr. Mercer veer suddenly into an alley to get off of the main street. She saw up ahead that the soldiers had created an improvised check point. She followed Mr. Mercer into the alley and saw him standing near a set of stairs that led down to a lower level of a building. He waved her over to follow him. At the bottom of the stairs he produced a key ring and sifted through the numerous keys before finding the right one. He opened a battered door on rusty hinges. Tara winced at the squealing grinding sound the door made, hoping it wouldn't draw too much attention to them. 

Once inside, he closed the door. "This is as far as we'll make it today," he said. "I didn't expcet there to be checkpoints and soldiers. You'll be safe enough here for the time being."

Tara looked around and found herself in a basement storeroom lined with barrels and boxes of goods. It was cold and a little damp in the basement. A trickle of light entered through streetside windows that were partly concealed by bars and grime.

Mr. Mercer moved on the shelves aside and revealed a smaller room with a bed and a lamp. "Stay in here. Try to keep quiet and I will return when I can." He handed her a small parcel wrapped in cloth. She opened it to find a quarter of a loaf of bread and a few slices of chesse. "This is all I could muster in such a short time."

She was grateful for the privision, but really wanted information. "Mr. Mercer, please tell me what is happening."

"I don't know all of the details yet, but your friend from the prison found me in the street and stopped me. She was in such a state that I tried to shrug her off, thinking her nothing more than a nuisance. She persisted and finally told me that soldiers had shown up at the prison in the morning, led by a someone she described as the most evil looking man she had ever seen. She thought she heard your name and listened in on their conversation. It seems that the warden made a mistake releasing you from the prison. Now the soldiers and guards have been ordered to find you with all possible haste."

"I see. Is this because of my father?"

"I can only assume. I don't know how much information I'll be able to gather without attracting attention. What matters now is that you wait here until I return."

Without thinking Tara said suddenly, "Someone will need to tell Avalon."

Mr. Mercer did not seem to understand her. He replied, "Tell who?"

"Avalon, the woman you're helping. We need to tell her where I am. She'll worry otherwise."

Again, Mr. Mercer acted as if he didn't know who Avalon was and why communicating anything to her might matter to him. He merely replied, "Unfortunatey, I don't know what your talking about. I will return."
