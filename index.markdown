# Chapter 1: More Than This #

"Where is Avalon? I want to see Avalon!" the princess shouted, running in her morning dress to her bedroom door. She slammed herself against it, surprised for a moment by how sturdy and unforgiving it was, unbending even to the wishes of its princess.

"Princess, please. Please I beg you..."

The princess turned, leaving the little hurt caused by the door behind. She pivoted into her frustration and anger, turning to the chambermaid. She raised a delicate arm with its pointed finger straight at the unassuming young woman, "You! You're the cause of this."

The chambermaid, clutching the princess' daytime undergarments, trying desperately to get her dressed so she could move on to her other morning chores, took a step back, took several in fact, catching her foot on the base of the clawed dressing table. "No, I promise you. This isn't me. I delivered the house mistress your request. I swear."

Now circling around a worn spot in the layered carpets in her chambers, the princess fumed, "No you didn't. You're a sneaking and conniving thing." She paused, "And you're not good at your job. I know. I saw when you attended Avalon. I saw your little mistakes then, and I see them now. There's nothing left to do but..." The princess made for a lattice-work grill at the end of a pipe extending from the wall.

The chambermaid dashed towards the princess, seized her arm without realizing what she was doing, "Please no..."

The princess tore away from the chambermaid's grasp. "How dare you! You could be executed for doing that!"

The chambermaid went rigid, straightened herself up, but bowed her head low. "Please forgive me, princess. It's just that..."

"Just what?" The chambermaid was silent. "Go on. Explain yourself."

"If I'm reassigned one more time, I may be expelled from the house. And then my mother. My poor dear mother. What will we do?"

The chambermaid was on the verge of crying. The princess could see that, could see the young woman's shoulders quivering under her dark servant's dress. The princess turned away from her maid, folded her arms tightly across her body. She closed her eyes and took a breath. Just as Avalon had taught her. Avalon was the only person who could lift her from these angers she had, the sads, and other unwanted feelings.

She wanted to see Avalon, because then everything would feel right and better. She would be who she really was and who she really wanted to be, the beloved princess, the treasure, the token. But she couldn't see Avalon and now she made her maid cry. What would Avalon say?

The princess turned back to the maid. "Fine. Say you're sorry and I will forget your indiscretion. "

The chambermaid curtsied and said in a hushed voice, "I'm truly sorry princess. You are merciful and..."

"You don't need to make a show out of it. Stop that and get me dressed."

"Yes your highness."

"And I want to know the moment that Avalon is available to be seen. Do you understand?"

"Of course. As soon as we're done I will tell the house mistress."

"Good, then we have an understanding. Please proceed with my morning."

As the maid dressed her, the princess wished she had not scolded her the way she had. Normally her new maid was efficient, but chatty at same time. The princess enjoyed hearing about the gossip among the servants, even if she pretended otherwise.

Now the maid's efficiency felt forced, and her silence deliberate. But the princess let her finish her morning preparations and curstsey her way out of the princess's room.

As she normally did, the princess remained at her dressing table brushing out her long dark hair, until she was called down for breakfast. Normally one of the second or third tier maids would lightly knock on her door and whisper, "My lord and lady are ready for you, your highness."

The princess nearly dropped her brush when, instead of a light tap, there was a sharp rap on the door and it opened. The house mistress came into her room. She stopped, though, once inside the room, as was the custom and waited for the princess to acknowledge her.

The princess brushed her hair several more times, before turning in her chair to acknowledge that the house mistress, one of her mother's favorite servants, had entered her chambers.

The house mistress tilted her neck just enough to avoid breaching protocol, but didn't hide the brusque tension in the gesture.

Finally impatient with the little game they were playing, the princess said curtly, "Yes, what is it? Breakfast time again?"

"Yes your highness, but not just that. Your maid told me..."

"I knew she would go squealing to you..."

"I assure you there was no squealing involved. I simply wanted to inform you that I received your message about Avalon."

"Fine, then I expect to see her as soon as it is possible."

"Convenient, your highness."

"Convenient? Convenient for who?"

"Convenient for the priests and for Avalon."

"Priests!? What do they have to do with anything? I only ask for patience."

"Princess, as you well know, they have to do with many things."

The princess scrutinized the house mistress closely, looking her up and down. The woman seemed more imperious than usual. What was the reason?

The princess stood and swept her way in her fine dress to the windows overlooking a cultivated garden outside the great house where she lived. "I don't understand all of this talk about convenience and patience."

She could hear the wizened woman let out a barely detected sigh, "Yes, your highness, but I have orders that you are not to disturb Avalon until it is convenient, for her, as well as the priests."

"And these orders came from?"

"From my lady, your highness."

The princess fumed, tightening her fingers into white knuckled knots, "Well that figures. There is only one solution for this, and that solution lies beyond one. I will take my leave for breakfast now."

"As you wish, your highness." The house mistress retreated from her room, leaving the princess alone in her room with her anger and frustration.

She stood at the window for several minutes, watching the gardeners pushing carts along the grounds, trimming hedges, picking weeds, and doing the hundreds of tasks that the King's, her father's house required, to maintain its stature as the finest and grandest house in the land.

***

Her mother and father sat at a long table in the great hall eating breakfast. Servants stood stiffly in the wings, waiting to attend to the King and Queen's needs.

Her father looked up and nodded at her in acknowledgement then returned to reading from a despatch box of papers spread out around him. Her mother wiped her mouth carefully and motioned her to an empty seat.

"Sit darling and eat your breakfast."

She plodded into the room and plopped into the chair, wanting her dissatisfaction to register plainly. But the plodding and plopping barely registered with her father.

Her mother arched and eyebrow and gave her father a meaningful look, but the King ignored her, preferring to grunt over whatever it was he reading at the moment.

The princess ignored her mother's meaningful look and made room for the servants to place her breakfast before her. She knew that if she could engage her father, she could get the barriers keeping her from visiting Avalon to go away.

"Father, must you read at the table."

"Your father is busy right now and those papers must be returned. Now dear, let's talk about our day."

"Our day? What day?"

"Why this day, of course. Today. Why, what other day would I be referring to?"

"How am I to know? Why does today deserve a day? That's my question."

Her father peered up from his papers and said gruffly, "The priests are due to arrive today, you know that," and went back to her reading.

The princess could see a look of exasperation pass across her mother's face, as if some agreed upon stratagem between her mother and father had broken down. If her mother had been the type, she imagined that she would have kicked the King under the table.

Instead, she composed her self, took another sip of coffee. When her cup clinked back down, she looked at the princess again, as if ready for another volley, "Yes, as your father said, the priests are due to arrive. And, darling, it causes such a disturbance. I thought it would be pleasant to plan an outing. I already have the warden making preparations. I thought we could observe the deer in the eastern forest. The warden told me that there a new season of fawns have been born. What do you say?"

The princess eyed her parents and decided to charge ahead, full frontal, with her demand, rather than retreat behind the pleasant plans that her mother was trying to distract her with. "I want to see Avalon. She's been gone for weeks now and I want to see her."

"Out of the question," her father replied, in the voice he reserved for ministers and commanders, and sometimes his daughter.

"But father..."

"Dear, what your father means..."

Her father, the King, put down his papers and replied, "What your father means is no. You are forbidden to see Avalon until you are told otherwise. Do you understand?" The princess slumped in her chair. "Do you understand?"

"Yes, father."

Her father's eyes brightened and he smiled at her mother, he bushy mustache crinkling around his mouth, "Good, then we have an understanding. No more talk of Avalon until otherwise noted."

Her mother, following her father's example, smiled as well. "Good. Then about that outing..."

***

The east woods were at the very edge of the King's personal estate. Surely her mother had chosen that location on purpose. They would spend most of the day just traveling there and back.

The princess was not in the mood to ride horses, much to her mother's disappointment. Her mother had met her out near the stables in her riding attire, seemingly bounding with energy. The princess had changed into traveling attire, but nothing that was appropriate to wear riding.

Besides, even if she had been in the mood to ride, which truthfully she probably was, she wasn't going to satisfy her mother's sense of mission and duty to distract her today, but saddling up her favorite horse. She gave the chestnut horse a few gentle pats on his nose, before meeting her mother at the carriage.

They sat out, a train of two carriages, on the rough roads to the east woods. Her mother's companion rode with them in one carriage. Two servants rode with their provisions in another. A forestman and the warden rode alongside the train on horseback.

As they rocked and rattled over the roads, her mother chatted freely with her companion about all manner of things going on in the kingdom and the household. From time to time, her mother would lean across and pat the princess's arm, "Darling, cover your ears for this part," whenever the talk turned to some item of personal business that her mother deemed unsuitable for her.

The princess would half-heartedly comply, but really her mind was far away. In fact, her mind was wandering through the stories that Avalon often told her when she visited her. She found herself in other lands, some arid and dry, others nothing more than small islands dotting an exanse of water.

She could imagine the warriors that fought long dangerous battles in Avalon's stories. She could hear the whispers and intrigue inside the royal courts that always seemed more exciting and glamorous than the court she lived in.

When Avalon told her stories, new worlds opened up to the princess, worlds she could hardly fathom, and assumed she would never see in person, at least not until the distant future when young father and mother had passed on their titles became hers.

Assuming they did. Assuming she wanted them. That's what being with Avalon impressed upon her the most. There was more in the world than the household she lived in and all of the constraints that came along with that. She couldn't imagine giving up being a royal, of course, perhaps the most important royal family of them all. Her father was the Divine King, after all.

But even now as she rocked along on some winding but unbending route to the eastern woods, she couldn't help but let her imagination wander among those lands, those places, those people that seemed much more than this, whatever this was at the moment.

***

"Why don't you go exploring?" her mother said to her, as if she was still a little girl in plaited braids, full of dimples and cute sayings. Her mother was busy overseeing the servants setting up for lunch. The forestman and warden were busy trundling the heavy lunch table from spot to spot, trying to follow her mother's wayward gestures.

The princess sighed and decided to set off into the woods after all. She followed the trickling sound of the creek that flowed through the woods, half remembering that a rustic wooden bridge crossed the creek at some point.

The flood and flow of instructions from the picnic spot stared to give way to rustle of creatures in the forest bed, to bids chirping in the tress above.

"You actually like the woods," she said out loud to herself, a habit she associated with her younger self. She had put that habit away recently now that she was properly older and talking to yourself was not proper.

She replied silently: Yes but that was before and this is now.

Regardless, she felt a flutter of excitement upon seeing the bridge, remembering when crossing that bridge meant crossing to a new world, a new land. Maybe one of the land's from Avalon's stories. There had been a period of time when Avalon's stories did come to life around her in places like that, places that seemed different from some other place.

She stopped in the middle of the bridge, crouching down to watch the rippling current pass under her. Small fish darted along the sandy bottom that glistened in the sunlight. She saw a turtle making its way across the creek, opposite of the direction she was heading in.

Pausing, she studied its slow, persistent motions, watched it kick and glide its way across the creek's current. It didn't move with great urgency, but it made its way.

Once the turtle disappeared in the brush lining the creek, the princess continued across to the other side. When her feet touched the ground again, she suddenly remembered a grove of old trees where she would spent hours as a little girl. She wondered if she could remember where it was.

Up to this point, she had been following a very rough narrow trail, probably made by the woodsman or maybe people long before them who had wandered these woods. She knew from Avalon that these woods weren't always part of the estate. But those times seemed as far removed as the far away worlds in Avalon's stories.

The grove she remembered wasn't on the trail. She thought she needed to strike off to the left at some point. As she walked, she remembered a series of mossy boulders that had been the marker for her to turn. There were the rocks just up ahead.

Even now she could picture herself walking into deepest parts of the forest, the tree cover getting thicker, the world feeling very far away. But something was different. The way up ahead seemed much lighter than before. Up ahead and to the right, she realized that a road had been cut into the woods.

When she reached the road, she stopped and stared down the ragged, turning path it made. She couldn't tell exactly where it went. But it cut in the opposite direction too, towards the grove. She turned and followed the road.

The road was littered with splinted and split wood. Much of it was still relatively bright and fresh looking. "This road is still new," she said out loud.

As she reached the road's terminal point, she gasped. She gasped because she was walking into a clearing, a clearing that she had never seen before now. This clearing wasn't a pleasant meadow full of weedy grasses and grazing animals. It was barren and stumpy, littered with the remnants of the trees that had been chopped down and taken away.

"They've cut down the trees!" she cried out, out loud again. She replied in her mind: Of course they did. Where do you think they get wood for furniture and other things in the world?

She knew the counterpoint she raised was a reasonable one, but the realization hurt nonetheless. Seeing these razed trees just added to the corded up frustration she was already carrying today. She dropped to her knees and started to sob, letting the angry, frustrated tears flow freely.

***

She cried herself dry, and just knelt in the clearing, holding her face in her hands until a voice sounded out, "Why are you crying? Are you okay?"

She stood up and circled around, scanning the clearing of the voice that called out to her. She didn't see anyone and wondered if in her her current state she was hearing things.

Then she heard a branch break and a figure stepped into the clearer. The figure was really nothing more than a child, a boy, younger than her by several years, wearing a thin robe. His head was shaved, but already covered in a scruffy stubble, and he held onto to a coarse sack slung over his shoulder.

"Are you sure you're okay? I heard you crying."

The princess wiped at her eyes and nose, self-conscious of the color that had probably spread over her cheeks. She could almost hear her mother saying, "That's an ugly look you've got. Cheer up, darling." "I'm fine. And even if I wasn't it isn't any of your business."

The boy looked at her, turned his head and shrugged. "Okay, it sounded like you were pretty upset. I thought an animal was caught in a trap. I heard you crying from far away."

"I said I'm fine. "Why are you here?"

The boy scratched his head and then looked up at the sky, "Well that's a big a question. I don't know that I have time to answer that. Let me see..."

She cut him off, "I would like to know who are. You're trespassing in the King's lands."

"I am?" The boy looked around puzzled. "That's great!" In his enthusiasm he started off across the clearing, marching right past her.

"Wait! Stop! Where are you going?"

"I'm crossing the clearing. I got lost and wandered around for a long time, just hoping that I would end up where I was told to go. I really hope I'm not late."

"Late for what?" she asked, but the boy had already disappeared into the wood. She took off after her, leaving behind the spectacle of her sadness and grief among the stubble and stumps in the clearing.

She had to keep a quick pace to keep up with him. "Stop, please, stop."

The boy stopped in his tracks and turned to her, finally allowing her to ask again, "Where are you going?

"Well, I'm really not supposed to say."

"So it's a secret."

"Kind of, yes. I would say it's a secret."

"What if I command you to tell me?"

The boy erupted in a laugh that doubled him over, "Command me? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. You can't command someone to tell a secret." Then the boy became reflective and stared at her intensely, "Can you?"

"Well I am a princess, so I believe that I can, yes."

"You're a princess? I've never met a real princess before." He started circling around her.

"There aren't any princesses where you're from, wherever you're from?"

"No, not that I'm aware. No princesses. There's are other people that give orders and tell others what to do, but no princesses."

"So I take it you're not one of these, how did you put it, 'people who tell other people what to do'?"

"Not really. Well, maybe... Not yet."

"What kind of answer is that? I'm completely confused by you. You are the most confusing boy I've ever met."

"I apologize. You're not the first person to say that to me."

Now that he was closer to her, the princess how tightly his skin stretched over his round face. The sun had turned his skin darker than hers. His finger nails were unkempt and dirty. He had a look of being generally disorderly and not well cared for.

And yet here he was wandering the world, wandering into her world, on the King's lands with some kind of secret purpose that he refused to share with her.

The boy's stomach grumbled, "I need to keep walking, I don't want to be late."

They started walking again, though the boy's pace was slower than before, "Are you hungry? Thirsty?" she asked him.

"I'm starving but I don't have time to waste. I made a promise and I have to keep that promise."

"But surely that promise should allow for tending to your basic needs. It doesn't sound like a very good promise that won't allow you to eat or sleep or other things to keep living. How will you fulfill your promise if you can't survive?"

"That's a good point. I really am hungry. Do you have anything to eat?"

"I don't..." the boy's face sank in disappointment, "But I know where to get food."

"Is it far away?"

"No it's very close."

"How close?"

"Just down this path. There is a another clearing, a proper clearing, along the creek."

"And there is food there? What kind of place is this? Is this a magical forest?"

"No silly, it's the King's Forest. The Eastern Forest to be exact. It's not magical, not in that way."

"Then why is there food just laying around in the woods? It's not just a bunch of mushrooms is it? I can't stand mushrooms. That's all I've eaten for days. That and a few birds eggs."

The princess tried to imagine this boy climbing up a tree to steal bird eggs. It was surprisingly easy to image this happening. "My mother is there, setting up a picnic. We brought too much food for just the two of it. You're welcome to some if it, if you'd like it."

"I would love that. Let's walk faster. Faster walking, sooner eating. That's my motto."

The princess assumed that it wasn't, in fact, his motto, but she smiled at the spirit anyway, and picked up her pace to try to stay abreast with the little boy who was barreling down the wooded path.

***

They startled her mother as they came crashing through the woods and entered the picnic spot. Her mother gasped, one of the servants nearly dropped a tray. The princess scanned the spot, only her mother, her mother's companion and the servant remained. The forestman and the warden were no longer part of the party.

"Darling, where have you been, and who in the world do you have with you?"

"I was wandering in the woods, just as you told me do." She decided not to share with her mother the news about the clearing at this time. "And this... This is..."

"Oh, my name is Leif," the boy said.

The princess nudged him and whispered, "Your majesty."

"But I'm not a majesty," the boy replied at full volume, clearly confused by what she meant.

"No, her, my mother. She's the queen. Say you're majesty and bow."

The boy's eyes were even wider than when he had learned she was a princess, "You're a queen. Pleased to meet you you're majesty. I've never met a real life Queen before."

"That's quite alright and to be expected," her mother replied. The princess was already annoyed at the tone that her mother was taking.

"Leif has been traveling and is hungry. I invited him to picnic with us."

"With us? Why I don't know dear."

The princess rushed forward she sat on knees before her mother, in a pose of daughterly pleading. "Please mother, he seems very good natured and so very hungry. Think of the good it will do."

It wasn't clear, even to her, what kind of good feeding the boy would do exactly, but she could see that her appeal to doing good in the world struck a chord with her mother. In a hushed tone her mother replied, "That is fine dear. We will make a place for him to eat, but over there."

"No! Mother! He must eat with us."

"I was hoping for a pleasant picnic with my daughter..."

"Mother..."

"Fine. Very well, I am much much too pliable a parent. Wouldn't you agree?" she asked her lady's companion, who nodded and replied with a terse, "Yes, my lady. But in bending, you model the true meaning of grace for your daughter."

"I had not considered it in that light." her mother replied. The princess know that her mother always looked positively on opportunities to school her in the correct courtly manner. Her mother's upbringing, by her own telling, had been marked by many such lessons and had led to her consider rise in station and status. Presumably she carried the same expectations for her daughter, to marry well and advance the family's name.

Her mother looked over her should at the boy and said, "Young man, my daughter says that you are hungry, please come join us for our picnic."

"I would love to!" the boy dashed forward, stopped himself, bowed in a halting way, and added, "Your majesty."

***

The boy was either masterfully evasive or much too hungry to answer questions in a clear manner. As they ate on the spread out linens covering the grass by the creek, they chattered and discussed and gossiped, but he remained very quiet. Not exactly quiet, the princess observed. He made a terrible ruckus and mess when he ate, in part because every bit he took had an attending commentary.

After several attempts to draw him out and reveal more details about himself, her mother finally gave up and turned her attention to her companion. The princess scooted herself closer to the boy so they could talk more privately without the adults overhearing what they were saying.

"Do you want to know why I was crying?" she asked him.

He took another bite of the cold roast quail and nodded his head, "Of course. I wouldn't have asked," he said through his bites of food.

"It was the trees."

"The trees?" he seemed puzzled. "I didn't see any trees."

"That's my point. That's why I was crying. That used to be a grove of very special trees, at least to me when I was younger. Now they're gone."

The boy had stopped eating, "What happened to them?"

"Cut down, I assume. Didn't you see the tree stumps and broken branches everywhere?"

"I was too distracted by your crying"

"That's not a nice thing to say."

"I didn't mean anything by it."

She settled the play of anger that crossed into her voice, "It's fine. I didn't know that the trees had been cut down. I was surprised, and I...I don't know, I just started to cry."

"Do you feel better?"

"I guess. I don't know. I would feel better if the trees had not been cut down."

The boy stared off past her at the creek as it bubbled along past them.

"What are you look at?"

"The creek. The water. Do you ever wonder if the water knows where it is going?"

The princess turned to watch the water. "I've never really considered it."

"It's carried along by something it doesn't really understand, but it keeps flowing, keeps being water either way."

The princess looked at him, not quite sure what the say. Where had this observation come from? He seemed so careless, even carefree about the world around him. She had spent countless hours watching these waters pass her by and had never thought anything like that before. He was the strangest little boy she had ever met.

***

The picnic was over and her mother announced it was time to return to the house. Returning meant starting the early evening rituals that took place before dinner. The princess knew that she had nothing to look forward to but another round of washing and dressing, being handled by her maid, a long dinner with any guests or courtiers were still lingering about the house. Then even an even longer time spent in the parlor with her mother and the other ladies.

She detested playing cards, and could only read for a brief time before the parlor's heat and the dull atmosphere put her to sleep. Then her mother would inevitably scold her for dozing off like a common laborer on the side of the road. "It is, and certainly will be, your duty to inject life and vitality into whatever situation you find yourself in. As the betters of so many, so many will look to you. You are a..."

Spark, madam," her companion would invariably interject.

"Yes, precisely. A spark. And those in your company are just cords of wood waiting to be lit by you. Don't you understand, dear?"

Some version of this conversation had played out so many time, so many nights. The princess could immerse herself in the scene just sitting her in the rattling carriage. The only thing that pulled her out of this reverie of tedium was listening to the boy's excited conversations from the outside the carriage.

Her mother refused to allow the boy the ride inside with them. "He is too common, darling. I simply cannot allow it."

The princess knew that her mother would not budge. Sitting together with the boy in the rustic woods, eating their rustic picnic was one matter. She could only imagine the scene of horror her mother conjured as she imagined returning home, exiting the carriage, and meeting the servants, whose job was the greet them and ease their way inside, and their puzzled look.

"He says he has somewhere to be and doesn't want to be late."

"While I commend the young man for wanting to be punctual, I hardly see how it is our responsibility to aid him with managing his time."

"Mother, you are taking this too literally."

"Literal? Well what other way is there to take it. I am merely responding to the situation you have brought before me, the exact one, unless you mean something else."

"No mother," she replied, huffing under her breath. She was already growing tired of debating this point with her mother.

Her mother's companion leaned in again and whispered something in her mother's ear. "Yes, yes, I suppose I could allow that. Fine, seeing as how today's themes seem to be grace and charity, we can permit him to ride atop the carriage."

She turned to tell the boy the good news, but suddenly couldn't find him. Maybe he had wandered off already. She paced around the picnic site, but found him sitting against a tree, starting to doze off.

She nudged his shoulder, "My mother says you can come with us. It's okay?"

The boy spoke through his yawn, "That's great news. Where are we going?"

"Home. To my home. I thought you said, you had somewhere to be. I thought you had some important secret appointment."

"Yes! and I can't be late. Does your carriage go fast?"

"As fast as a one horse carriage can travel on the roads we have this far out. Not fast, but fast enough."

"Well I can't complain. Besides I can hardly move a muscle after that lunch. I don't think I've ever seen that much food before."

Judging by the boy's look and how he had devoured so much food, the princess believed him.

"Darling, do close your sun shade," her asked. The princess realized that the late afternoon sun was starting to spread its bright light around them and through the carriage window on her side. She drew the shade, but not before realizing that they were close to home. They were crossing through one of the fields that was farmed. She could see lthe outlines of laborers in the fields swinging tools, stooping to pick and lift and drag.

With the shade drawn, the carriage was much darker. She leaned her head against the side of the carriage, closing her eyes to ride out the bumps and jostles until their day's journey ended.

Then she heard the driver call out and stern, "Whoa now." The carriage lurched to a stop.

"What's going on? Why are we stopping?" her mother asked.

The princess shrugged, having not more information that she did. She assumed that her mother was worried about bandits. She always fretted about bandits, even when they were traveling on their estate, on the King's lands.

She turned her head to the side of the carriage with the open window and suddenly met with the boy's upside down face.

"There are travelers up ahead, so we stopped."

The boy's face disappeared before he could hear her mother whisper to her companion, "Must be the priests. They typically arrive in a procession."

They sat still for several minutes in the middle of road. Suddenly she could hear horse hoofs pounded alongside then past them. The warden or forestman must be riding ahead. The travelers, even if they were priests, would have to give the right of way to the monarch's carriage, even though the monarch wasn't technically inside the carriage.

She could hear the reins crack and the driver give a little "Hiyah" Then they started to move again. As they approached the travelers, she peeled back the edge of the curtain to get a better look at the people who had parted to let them pass.

Much to her disappointment, though, she couldn't tell much about the figures lining the road. They were dressed in robes and many of them were hooded. They kept their heads low and faces out of site. Their robes were not uniform. Some were more or less plain than others. None were particularly lavish, nothing like her father's ceremonial robes.

She could only guess that these figures were in fact priests, the priests who had disrupted her day and kept her from Avalon. She didn't really know though, because she had never been allowed to see the priests up close before. And it had only been recently that she understood that there was some kind of connection between the priests and AValon.

The nature of that connection was a complete mystery to her. She never really considered why this connection was a myster. had someone forgot to tell her? Was she being lied to? Or had she just never stopped to think much about it.

Crosing through this parted stream of travelers though but the question at the forefront of her thoughts. But those forming thoughts were jostled out of her when the carriage came to a sudden halt. She pitched back into the cushions behind her. Her mother and her mother's companion lurched forward.

"Goodness, what is happening out there!?" her mother cried out.

"We're being stopped, my lady," the driver replied.

"Stopped by who?"

The driver didn't reply, or if he did, his response was drowned out by another voice. A loud, stern, deep voice that also cried out, "What were you thinking!? Get down from the carriage at once!"

The passengers in the carriage looked at each other, utterly confused. The princess pulled open the curtain, blinded momentarily by the surge of light that flooded in the interior. She poked her head out to see a tall man, one of the passengers, leading the boy away from the carriage, grabbing him by the collar, jerking along to the side of the road.

Moments later someone was rapping at the carriage door. Her mother's companion opened the door. The man she saw was now in full view, filling the door's frame.

He was severe and sharp angled. Old, but not weak like the old laborers and servants she was used to seeing. This man was old but vital. Regal, but not royal. She also noticed that his robes were much finer than many of the others she had seen. The also wore some kind of amulet close against his chest that peeked out from the tops of his clothes.

"Your majesty, allow me to apologize."

"High Priest, please explain yourself. I nearly suffered an injury for all of this jostling about on the road."

"Again, I apolgoize your majesty. There has been a most unusual occurance, a deviation from our forms and codes. Please be assured that the trangresser will be punished."

"Who are you talking about?" the princess interjected. Her mother was pleased.

The man locked eyes with her. In that moment, she could feel that she had been studied, ascertained. He nodded his head at her, "Your highness. We have only met through the stories the King and Queen have shared. I regret that our first meeting had occur under these circumstances."

"Please explain yourself," her mother cut in.

"The boy, the boy on our carriage. Where did you find him?"

"My daughter met him in the woods. He seemed like a troubled soul in need of nourishment and care. So we offered him our charity."

"A noble instinct, of course." Her mother's companion nodded knowingly at this comment. "But that...that boy isn't just a boy."

"Then who is he? Plesae do not leave us in the dreadful suspense," her mother replid.

"Of course. He is the newest, and youngest member, of my order."

The princess blurted out, "You mean he is a priest."

"That is exactly what I mean your highness. A priest of only a month, and still new, very new, to our ways, but a priest nonetheless."

Her mother chuckled, which seemed natural, if a little indecorous, "But he's just a boy!"

"Yes, I am afraid so. But the priesthood is in just a state these days that we must take the candidates we are given. He was the only candidate put forth by his people. But he should have known that we are charged with a solemn duty to perform and are not mingle with people of the world until that duty is discharged. I hesitate to say it, but he was put everything our duty bounds us to do at risk."

"Well, please know, that had I known, I...we would never have."

"Of course not your Majesty, please understand that I do not blame you. But I'm afraid we are losing day, and losing time. We have many tasks to perform, as you well know. We must be on our way."

"As must we, there are household matters to attend to."

"Very well. I take my leave and promise that the boy will not be a concern of yours anymore."

"I am pleased to hear it. Driver? Driver? Carry on and take us home, please."

The carriage starting rolling again. The princess fell back into her seat, still staring out the window. As they passed the contingent of priests, she could help but look for the boy. There he was, held in place by the High Priest's firm grip on his shoulder.

She caught his eyes just before they were too far out of sight. He looked as miserable as she felt right now.

# Chapter 2: The Space Between #

Dinner that night proved to be even more agonizing than usual. The princess made her appearance as she was obligated to do, at the time she was obligated to appear.

The only motivation she could muster inside was a strong desire to know if the High Priest would be a dining with them that night. She wasn't so much interested in the High Priest himself, though she was curious what her assessment of her had been, but wanted to hear more about the boy.

It would be right to say that she had been fretting from the time she returned home to the time she stepped foot in the long narrow dining room, but she could feel a constant tug of anxiety and concern in the back of her mind. That subtle yet gnawing sensation had made it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything and made time pass more slowly than usual.

The priests had vanished from view once they arrived on the grounds. She wondered where they could be going, and what important business they were attending to. As she had earlier in the day, she started to marvel over the fact that she either had never noticed, or never taken much interest in the contingent of robed figures who would appear at their house on some semi-regular basis.

Certainly she knew that the priests existed and knew that they were a very secretive order. She knew that her father relied on them in some capacity in his role as king, but she could not even begin to formulate what this interaction must look like.

Mulling over what little information she did have, she had decisively come to the conclusion that the little boy was an unlikely candidate to be a priest. The priests they passed on the road seemed so removed form life, so rigid and formal. The High Priest, in particular, seemed of this world, but also stood apart from it.

Perhaps that's why she wondered what he had made of her when he fixed his gaze upon her. She couldn't say it words, but instinctively knew that he was judging her by some criteria that she could not access and did not know, maybe could not know.

She wondered which parts of himself that little boy would have to trim away, like a gardener at a hedgerow, to become the kind of priest who wouldn't be pressed down by someone like the High Priest.

Once in the dining room, with the service about to being, she felt her interest in the proceedings diminish when she saw that the guests were just some minor official, a judge, and a some lesser nobleman and his wife.

Throughout the dinner she followed the protocols that she knew almost instinctively now. She feigned interest when it seemed that she should, and disengaged when it was clear the guests were speaking of subjects that didn't include her.

As the princess, the guests around her felt obliged to engage in some brief back and forth, which usually amounted to questions about her education or reading, or about the house and grounds. She wasn't inclined to talk much about the former, and didn't care to know much about the later.

So after a few awkward volleys, the guest would usually shrug and turn back to the table's conversation, satisfied that they had done their duty as guests in the King's house to engage his daughter. If nothing else, this would allow each on to say later over nightcaps or a game of cards, "Yes, a perfectly charming young woman. You must be so proud." At which point the adults would nod in agreement, and move on to other concerns.

Over the course of the service, she had become so lulled into the routine of feigning and disengaging that she didn't hear her mother addressing a direct question to her, something her mother rarely, if never, did in these formal settings. "Dear, remind us how you came across the boy."

Putting on her most agreeable princess demeanor, she replid, "The boy? Mother"

"Yes, the young priest. The judge was just asking about him, having heard previously before about the youngest priest to even be accepted into the order."

"Yes, I was telling your mother that if it weren't for the writings and decisions of one of most revered jurists of the last generation, the young man would not have been considered for the spot. Naturally, being a man of the law, I take great interest when legal theory materializes in the practical."

"We were in the eastern forest, as I'm sure mother has already explained. I was talking a walk. I came upon a grove I remembered visiting as a little girl. I was surprised to find that it had been cut down and the trees removed from the forest."

"What that old cyprus grove?" her father interjected. "We had those trees removed months ago. Had I known you had an attachment to the spot, I would have told your sooner."

She didn't care to hear more of an explanation about the trees and their fate. "Yes, father. As I said, I was surprised to see the trees gone and then there he was, asking me if I was okay."

"Why wouldn't you have been okay, dear?" her mother asked, but moved along the conversation when her daughter didn't reply. "You see the boy just wandered onto the estate. We had no idea who he was until we encountered the High Priest."

"The boy didn't tell you who he was?" the lesser nobleman asked.

"No, isn't that the strangest thing."

"In my limited experience, the priests observe their own ways closely, and care little for ours," the official said.

"My great-uncle was part of the priesthood, for a time," the nobleman's wife interjected. Even the princess knew that this nobleman's wife came from a disgraced family, so it was a surprise that she brought up and branch of it at all.

"Certainly my experience today has spoken to their strange ways," her mother concluded.

"You must remember my love that the priests bear a heavy burden and perform an important role. We must honor and respect their desire to protect their customs."

"But what will happen to him?" the princess blurted, almost interrupting her father, which was frowned up, especially during formal events like this, and around his subjects.

"Happen?" her father replied, tilting his head in confusion. "Why I suppose after the have finished their tasks that he will be punished."

The magistrate added, "The priests are known for their creative punishments."

"But why? Why punish him at all?" she cried out. "Did he really do anything that wrong? He's just a child."

"But, he is a priest," the magistrate replied. "His life is bound up with a different set of rules than ours. Those rules were broken. That is the logic that law follows...theirs and ours." The judge nodded his approval, affirming that the law did, in fact, work this way.

The princess tried to not be visibly upset. She could not tell how effectively she was doing this. Perhaps not that well. Her father stepped in to halt the conversation any further, "You must put this aside, it is no concern of ours what happens to this boy, this priest. Let us close this matter up."

"I agree," her mother added. "We need space between us and this unpleasant subject."

The princess knew she could not leave the table, not without breaching more protocol than she already did. She knew her father, who generally was an indulgent father, was barely tolerating her transgression just now.

***

The princess awoke the next morning to a dark room, even after the chambermaid had pulled back heavy curtains covering her windows. "It will be a gray day today, your highness," the maid commented.

The princess turned over in bed, shutting out the windows, and buried her head in her pillow. She opened one forcefully shut eye and saw the chambermaid's blurry outline standing alongside the bed. The chambermaid had her hands crossed, and very meekly said, "Should I have the house mistress tell your mother you're not well, princess?"

The princess closed her open eye, squeezed both tightly together, considered the matter, and said, "Yes, I'm not well this morning."

The chambermaid replied a soft, "Very well" and quietly left the room, leaving the princess to the silent contours of her dark, gray room.

She lost track of how long she lay there, tossing back and forth. She wasn't comfortable. It didn't feel like a luxury to be laying there broken out the household's pace. Her back ached and her head too. A daytime heat rose up through her body, which would have been pleasant during a nighttime chill, but now just irritated and agitated her.

She bolted up in bed just as her mother walked in with the house mistress. Her mother began buzzing about her room, making offhand observations, "I must come in your chambers more often...this table is much too shabby...make a note that we must replace these lamps with something else. I can't bear to look at them..."

The house mistress dutifully followed her mother, recording these observations in a notebook she kept around her neck, suspended him a braided silver chain.

They stopped at the foot of her bed. "Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better," her mother said. "I have very exciting news for you."

The princess rubbed her hands through the thick dark tangle of her hair. "What's the news?" She was already convinced that it wouldn't be exciting enough to rouse her out of her agitated state.

"The priests are completing their rituals and by all accounts they have been very successful." As she said this, the princess wondered what this meant, and if her mother knew what this meant. "So, your father, at my request, has approved hosting a ball, here, tomorrow night. We are already making plans. Invitations are being sent by couriers as we speak. Isn't this simply wonderful news? It's been far too long since we've hosted a ball."

The princess had vague memories of previous balls where she had been trundled around like a small object of great value, passed through the hands of visitors from different corners of the kingdom. Remarked upon, marveled at when she performed some cute trick that children inevitably learn to dazzle the adults in the room.

"And for you, darling, it's been much too long. I realize only now how cruel it has been to keep you out of society. Your father and I have been much too wrapped up in the kingdom's business. But that all changes, starting today." Her mother paused, "And listen, listen here. I promise you that will have more of my attention during this very important transition in your life. Not just your life. All of our lives. We need to properly introduce you to society and lay the groundwork for what comes next."

"What comes next?" the princess asked.

"Adulthood, marriage. Titles. Everything. Just as I experienced. You will experience, only on a much grander scale. I will be sure of that."

"Mother, it's too early to have my life plotted out for me. Can we wait until after luncheon?"

"Too early? It feels like we're positively wasting the day. Come now, it's time to get up. There's so much to do."

"Uggh, fine. But when can I see, Avalon? It's been far too long."

Her mother, who was about to leave her room, turned back and said in a feigned whisper, "Well, I wasn't supposed to say this, but there is a chance that you will be able to see Avalon at the ball."

***

Her mother kept her by her side for much of the day. Together they oversaw many of the preparations being made for the ball. Servants criss-crossed across the house, carrying linens, bringing fine wines from the cellar. Everywhere the princess looked servants were cleaning, dusting, polishing.

It had been several years since she had seen the ballroom, the topmost floor of the grand house's central wing. When she was much younger, her governess at the time would allow her to romp in the large space, lined with windows, when the weather didn't allow them to be outside.

Her governess at the time had extolled exposure to nature. Her mother had been reluctant at first, but came to understand that this method of education was becoming more fashionable among in the elites in the kingdom. Not wanting to be outdone, it seemed like there was a period of time when the princess lived much of her waking life outside.

It was also a period of time when she remembered Avalon truly entering her life, at least in a meaningful way. It was during these outdoor sessions that she had encountered Avalon with her governess, and formed an attachment to this person who had come to play such an important role in her life.

That governess had been released for some reason, the family's "relationship" as her mother had called it had come to an end. It was the beginning of a period of time when she saw Avalon more and governesses less. Occasionally a tutor in one subject or another would appear in her life, then readily disappear, partly due to the fact that she started to understand how to dispatch the people who were supposed to educate her, which then led to her having more time to spend in what ever way she chose.

The princess didn't feel that her education suffered much because of her tactics. She probably didn't grasp the subtleties of several dead languages, but she felt that she had learned so much about the world from Avalon. Besides, she wondered, certainly then, perhaps less so now, what a princess needed with stuffy tutors and their rote rehearsals of whatever subject matter they had mastered in their own youth.

Even though she had not been in the ballroom for years, it still seemed like a grand space. Though the weather prevented the space from being lit up and luminous with sunlight, the space still seemed large and took what light there was a turned it into magic. Even the columns of dust that swirled in the faint light seemed to glitter like a rare substance.

Perhaps it was a callback of her younger feelings about the space, about the governess, and Avalon, of those days when her life and, more importantly, her feelings about her life, were simpler, but she felt a ping of excitement course through her. She started to see the counters of the high vaulted ceiling in a different way, and could imagine the sounds of music and voices and dancing feet as they would curl about those vaults and resonate with a rich sound.

She started to trace out the lines in the intricate wooden floor, following the tracks of light and dark wood, hopping from diamond shape to square, with a combination of her natural and learned grace. The movement quickened her body, her cares started to feel further away. She begrudgingly admitted to herself that she was looking forward to the ball.

This excitement didn't completely blot out her concerns about the boy and her frustration over not seeing Avalon, but maybe the later issue would be resolved soon. As for the boy, perhaps, she started to argue with himself, he really did deserve any punishments that the priests administered. Maybe he had done something sever enough to deserve his treatment, or at least maybe she didn't know enough to say for sure.

This line of thinking took root in her mind as the day progressed, right until she was put into the hands of her mother's dressmaker. The dressmaker lived in a nearby village and been rushed to the estate to ready the Queen and Princess for the ball.

The princess spent several hours perched on top of a wobbling box in front of a mirror, twisting round and round. Pins seemed to thread in and out around her body at every imaginable angle.

It was too late to construct a new gown; so her and her mother would have to make due with taking a dress and altering it. In the princesss's case, the servants were able to bring down from storage several gowns that the princess had never worn, did not even recognize. Her mother, apparently, had been buying gowns for her without her event realizing it, storing them for an occasion when she might need them.

The dressmaker had to mend to dress to make it fit properly. Then she began ruching and pleating, pulling and pressing to change the dress' look. "And you're sure this is the style now?"

"Yes, my lady. I make it a point to keep up with the evolution of styles around the capital. Knowing that I may be called on in a situation exactly like this one."

The dressmaker's reply gave her mother great satisfaction. Her mother often bemoaned being so far from fashionable life in other parts of the kingdom. They spent so much of their time on her father's estate, where he preferred to spend his time. Because of this, the estate became the de facto court, and life in the kingdom shifted accordingly. At least this was the explanation that her mother would give when she was lamenting this facet of her life. "Not that I am not extremely privileged in other ways," her mother would add, not completely unaware that the Queen enjoyed privileges that many others did not.

***

By the next day, the princess' mood and outlook had changed considerably. She was genuinely looking forward to the ball, though not particularly keen on her mother's constant allusions to her entering society. One the thing the princess did not want was to feel that this society's eyes were watching her every move. She didn't feel ready to address herself to this being, this thing that her mother portrayed as being everywhere and everything all at once.

The princess felt that she was excited on her own terms. Not society's. Not her mother's. So she would enjoy the ball for what it was. By tomorrow, much of the turmoil she experienced the last few days would feel like a distant memory. The only problem she faced now was that the evening couldn't come soon enough.

Her mother did not want the princess with her like she did yesterday. This actually came as something of a relief, because her mother was controlled by her nerves now. Everything seemed to be teetering on the edge of disaster or coming together better than she could have hoped. She watch her mother bound these hills of despair and elation, being totally ignored by her, several times before she decided to slip away and roam the gardens outside.

The sun was shining again. The air was starting to feel cooler and crisp, but it was still warm enough to enjoyed ambling through the gardens.

She walked aimlessly for a while before deciding to walk by the hothouses where the gardeners cultivated flowers. Her father took a great interest in cultivating flowers, even hosted several competitions for other like himself. Even though he inevitably won these competitions, he was so deeply interested in the subject, that he barely seemed to notice that he had won. His inattention to this fact made the event tolerable for the other participants.

As she crossed the lawn to the hothouse, she realized that she would ask for help assembling a bouquet for Avalon, for when she saw her finally. She knew that Avalon loved flowers. When she would walk with Avalon and the governess, they would often steer their course to the hothouse to admire what was growing there.

She entered through the metal and glass door, letting the heat and humidity inside envelope her. She had almost felt chilly walking outside before entering. Now her clothes started to feel heavy and awkward. One of the gardeners greeted her. She started to approach him to make her request, but then noticed an unexpected figure down at the opposite end deeply examining the plants there.

The princess told the gardener she would return and walked closer to the figure, who she realized was the High Priest. She would not have assumed that a person like this would be admiring flowers the way he was.

The high priest looked up and noticed her before she could acknowledge him, "Ah, your highness. I didn't know that you were interested in the gardening and flowers."

"I was just passing through really...to ask the gardeners to cut a bouquet of flowers for me."

"Ah, yes, of course. Cut flowers do make for a pretty sight in one's room."

She felt dismissed by this remark and it bothered her. Why did this high priest seem to treat her like some kind of object under glass, something to be observed and commented upon? Was she doing something to invite this scrutiny?

"They do, but these are not for me."

The high priest leaned forward to more closely examine one of the flowers before him, he breathed in the flower's fragrance more deeply. "Who are they for?"

This seemed like a very forward question, but she felt compelled to answer him, to justify herself for some reason. "For my friend, for Avalon."

"Avalon? Do you see her often?"

"Not as much any more. But whenever I can, I visit with her."

"And the King and Queen approve of these visits?"

"I suppose they do." She decided to counter with a bold question of her own, "Why are asking these questions."

The High Priest drew up to full height, breathing in the air around him with a deep satisfied gulp. "Amazing isn't. So many flowers in this hothouse, so many fragrances, all releasing their scents into their air, all blending together. And yet I can still identify the scent of this flower here, it smells so particular and it lingers. And yet this flower, this particular species relies on..." he scanned the area around them then pointed out another type of flower, "...that one in order to pollinate and survive. So unique, yet so bound to what is around it."

He looked around, taking note of the workers in the hothouse that were nearby, "Please come walk with me." They left the hothouse with him guiding her by the arm, not forcefully, but his will seemed to channel itself through his touch. There was no mistaking that she was supposed to follow him and his direction. "I want to show you something."

They walked into one of the small orchards of fruit trees that had been planted generations ago. The trees never bore much fruit, just enough for pleasant fall time snacks. Most of the fruit had been harvested weeks before, leaving only the smell of sweet sour rotting fruit. She had to hop over the mushy masses that were left, even after the pigs had routed through the remains.

Another priest stood at the edge of the orchard, seemingly standing watch. The High Priest passed him without acknowleding him at all. The princess tried to catch the priests' attention, trying to get some piece of information to orient herself with. But, much like on the road before, the priest keep his eyes concealed, unmoved by whatever wild look of desperation might have passed her face.

The walked to the center of the orchard. As they grew closer, she could hear faint groans. Then she saw the boy laying on his side, clutching his stomach, groaning. She tried to rush forward to tend to him, but the priest's firm hand held her back.

"No, this is his punishment." She looked up at him. "Did you think he would be lashed or stoned. No, he is a priest, not a common criminal, but he needed to be punished."

"What did you do to him?"

"He was made to eat these rotted apples until I deemed he had enough."

"But he's sick now. He looks miserable."

"Yes and hopefully this young boy will carry this lesson forward with him."

"And that lesson is?"

"As priests, we are of this world, but not a part of it. We stand a part from it. And must not break that vow."

"Why is this code so important? What does it matter?"

"That is a question that I cannot answer here. But I will say this. When I look at you, I see a young person, on the verge of adulthood, full of so much potential..."

She must have given him a surprised look, because he stopped and added. "Yes, princess, I see potential in you, potential to be a great monarch, a wise ruler. But I also see currents in you that trouble me. I would never want the monarchy and priesthood to come into conflict. That would upset long standing understanding. You, this boy, even Avalon, yes, your precious Avalon, all have a role to play in that understanding, even though you don't realize it yet."

"I can't say more, but know that your actions from today forward, have great import, more meaning than you may realize. So the next time you meet one of my priests in a forest clearing, do not invite him to picnic, no matter your personal feelings. Your personal feelings are like these rotted apples to a priest, only foul spoilings that will leave us sick and twisted, not like a priest at all. Do you understand?"

The princes nodded, wincing slightly under his grip, which never loosened from her shoulder, and maybe even grew tighter as he delivered this speech or warning or threat to her.
