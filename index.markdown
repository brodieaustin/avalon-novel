# Chapter 1: More Than This #

"Where is Avalon? I want to see Avalon!" the princess shouted, running in her morning dress to her bedroom door. She slammed herself against it, surprised for a moment by how sturdy and unforgiving it was, unbending even to the wishes of its princess.

"Princess, please. Please I beg you..."

The princess turned, leaving the little hurt caused by the door behind. She pivoted into her frustration and anger, turning to the chambermaid. She raised a delicate arm with its pointed finger straight at the unassuming young woman, "You! You're the cause of this."

The chambermaid, clutching the princess' daytime undergarments, trying desperately to get her dressed so she could move on to her other morning chores, took a step back, took several in fact, catching her foot on the base of the clawed dressing table. "No, I promise you. This isn't me. I delivered the house mistress your request. I swear."

Now circling around a worn spot in the layered carpets in her chambers, the princess fumed, "No you didn't. You're a sneaking and conniving thing." She paused, "And you're not good at your job. I know. I saw when you attended Avalon. I saw your little mistakes then, and I see them now. There's nothing left to do but..." The princess made for a lattice-work grill at the end of a pipe extending from the wall.

The chambermaid dashed towards the princess, seized her arm without realizing what she was doing, "Please no..."

The princess tore away from the chambermaid's grasp. "How dare you! You could be executed for doing that!"

The chambermaid went rigid, straightened herself up, but bowed her head low. "Please forgive me, princess. It's just that..."

"Just what?" The chambermaid was silent. "Go on. Explain yourself."

"If I'm reassigned one more time, I may be expelled from the house. And then my mother. My poor dear mother. What will we do?"

The chambermaid was on the verge of crying. The princess could see that, could see the young woman's shoulders quivering under her dark servant's dress. The princess turned away from her maid, folded her arms tightly across her body. She closed her eyes and took a breath. Just as Avalon had taught her. Avalon was the only person who could lift her from these angers she had, the sads, and other unwanted feelings.

She wanted to see Avalon, because then everything would feel right and better. She would be who she really was and who she really wanted to be, the beloved princess, the treasure, the token. But she couldn't see Avalon and now she made her maid cry. What would Avalon say?

The princess turned back to the maid. "Fine. Say you're sorry and I will forget your indiscretion. "

The chambermaid curtsied and said in a hushed voice, "I'm truly sorry princess. You are merciful and..."

"You don't need to make a show out of it. Stop that and get me dressed."

"Yes your highness."

"And I want to know the moment that Avalon is available to be seen. Do you understand?"

"Of course. As soon as we're done I will tell the house mistress."

"Good, then we have an understanding. Please proceed with my morning."

As the maid dressed her, the princess wished she had not scolded her the way she had. Normally her new maid was efficient, but chatty at same time. The princess enjoyed hearing about the gossip among the servants, even if she pretended otherwise.

Now the maid's efficiency felt forced, and her silence deliberate. But the princess let her finish her morning preparations and curstsey her way out of the princess's room.

As she normally did, the princess remained at her dressing table brushing out her long dark hair, until she was called down for breakfast. Normally one of the second or third tier maids would lightly knock on her door and whisper, "My lord and lady are ready for you, your highness."

The princess nearly dropped her brush when, instead of a light tap, there was a sharp rap on the door and it opened. The house mistress came into her room. She stopped, though, once inside the room, as was the custom and waited for the princess to acknowledge her.

The princess brushed her hair several more times, before turning in her chair to acknowledge that the house mistress, one of her mother's favorite servants, had entered her chambers.

The house mistress tilted her neck just enough to avoid breaching protocol, but didn't hide the brusque tension in the gesture.

Finally impatient with the little game they were playing, the princess said curtly, "Yes, what is it? Breakfast time again?"

"Yes your highness, but not just that. Your maid told me..."

"I knew she would go squealing to you..."

"I assure you there was no squealing involved. I simply wanted to inform you that I received your message about Avalon."

"Fine, then I expect to see her as soon as it is possible."

"Convenient, your highness."

"Convenient? Convenient for who?"

"Convenient for the priests and for Avalon."

"Priests!? What do they have to do with anything? I only ask for patience."

"Princess, as you well know, they have to do with many things."

The princess scrutinized the house mistress closely, looking her up and down. The woman seemed more imperious than usual. What was the reason?

The princess stood and swept her way in her fine dress to the windows overlooking a cultivated garden outside the great house where she lived. "I don't understand all of this talk about convenience and patience."

She could hear the wizened woman let out a barely detected sigh, "Yes, your highness, but I have orders that you are not to disturb Avalon until it is convenient, for her, as well as the priests."

"And these orders came from?"

"From my lady, your highness."

The princess fumed, tightening her fingers into white knuckled knots, "Well that figures. There is only one solution for this, and that solution lies beyond one. I will take my leave for breakfast now."

"As you wish, your highness." The house mistress retreated from her room, leaving the princess alone in her room with her anger and frustration.

She stood at the window for several minutes, watching the gardeners pushing carts along the grounds, trimming hedges, picking weeds, and doing the hundreds of tasks that the King's, her father's house required, to maintain its stature as the finest and grandest house in the land.

***

Her mother and father sat at a long table in the great hall eating breakfast. Servants stood stiffly in the wings, waiting to attend to the King and Queen's needs.

Her father looked up and nodded at her in acknowledgement then returned to reading from a despatch box of papers spread out around him. Her mother wiped her mouth carefully and motioned her to an empty seat.

"Sit darling and eat your breakfast."

She plodded into the room and plopped into the chair, wanting her dissatisfaction to register plainly. But the plodding and plopping barely registered with her father.

Her mother arched and eyebrow and gave her father a meaningful look, but the King ignored her, preferring to grunt over whatever it was he reading at the moment.

The princess ignored her mother's meaningful look and made room for the servants to place her breakfast before her. She knew that if she could engage her father, she could get the barriers keeping her from visiting Avalon to go away.

"Father, must you read at the table."

"Your father is busy right now and those papers must be returned. Now dear, let's talk about our day."

"Our day? What day?"

"Why this day, of course. Today. Why, what other day would I be referring to?"

"How am I to know? Why does today deserve a day? That's my question."

Her father peered up from his papers and said gruffly, "The priests are due to arrive today, you know that," and went back to her reading.

The princess could see a look of exasperation pass across her mother's face, as if some agreed upon stratagem between her mother and father had broken down. If her mother had been the type, she imagined that she would have kicked the King under the table.

Instead, she composed her self, took another sip of coffee. When her cup clinked back down, she looked at the princess again, as if ready for another volley, "Yes, as your father said, the priests are due to arrive. And, darling, it causes such a disturbance. I thought it would be pleasant to plan an outing. I already have the warden making preparations. I thought we could observe the deer in the eastern forest. The warden told me that there a new season of fawns have been born. What do you say?"

The princess eyed her parents and decided to charge ahead, full frontal, with her demand, rather than retreat behind the pleasant plans that her mother was trying to distract her with. "I want to see Avalon. She's been gone for weeks now and I want to see her."

"Out of the question," her father replied, in the voice he reserved for ministers and commanders, and sometimes his daughter.

"But father..."

"Dear, what your father means..."

Her father, the King, put down his papers and replied, "What your father means is no. You are forbidden to see Avalon until you are told otherwise. Do you understand?" The princess slumped in her chair. "Do you understand?"

"Yes, father."

Her father's eyes brightened and he smiled at her mother, he bushy mustache crinkling around his mouth, "Good, then we have an understanding. No more talk of Avalon until otherwise noted."

Her mother, following her father's example, smiled as well. "Good. Then about that outing..."

***

The east woods were at the very edge of the King's personal estate. Surely her mother had chosen that location on purpose. They would spend most of the day just traveling there and back.

The princess was not in the mood to ride horses, much to her mother's disappointment. Her mother had met her out near the stables in her riding attire, seemingly bounding with energy. The princess had changed into traveling attire, but nothing that was appropriate to wear riding.

Besides, even if she had been in the mood to ride, which truthfully she probably was, she wasn't going to satisfy her mother's sense of mission and duty to distract her today, but saddling up her favorite horse. She gave the chestnut horse a few gentle pats on his nose, before meeting her mother at the carriage.

They sat out, a train of two carriages, on the rough roads to the east woods. Her mother's companion rode with them in one carriage. Two servants rode with their provisions in another. A forestman and the warden rode alongside the train on horseback.

As they rocked and rattled over the roads, her mother chatted freely with her companion about all manner of things going on in the kingdom and the household. From time to time, her mother would lean across and pat the princess's arm, "Darling, cover your ears for this part," whenever the talk turned to some item of personal business that her mother deemed unsuitable for her.

The princess would half-heartedly comply, but really her mind was far away. In fact, her mind was wandering through the stories that Avalon often told her when she visited her. She found herself in other lands, some arid and dry, others nothing more than small islands dotting an exanse of water.

She could imagine the warriors that fought long dangerous battles in Avalon's stories. She could hear the whispers and intrigue inside the royal courts that always seemed more exciting and glamorous than the court she lived in.

When Avalon told her stories, new worlds opened up to the princess, worlds she could hardly fathom, and assumed she would never see in person, at least not until the distant future when young father and mother had passed on their titles became hers.

Assuming they did. Assuming she wanted them. That's what being with Avalon impressed upon her the most. There was more in the world than the household she lived in and all of the constraints that came along with that. She couldn't imagine giving up being a royal, of course, perhaps the most important royal family of them all. Her father was the Divine King, after all.

But even now as she rocked along on some winding but unbending route to the eastern woods, she couldn't help but let her imagination wander among those lands, those places, those people that seemed much more than this, whatever this was at the moment.

***

"Why don't you go exploring?" her mother said to her, as if she was still a little girl in plaited braids, full of dimples and cute sayings. Her mother was busy overseeing the servants setting up for lunch. The forestman and warden were busy trundling the heavy lunch table from spot to spot, trying to follow her mother's wayward gestures.

The princess sighed and decided to set off into the woods after all. She followed the trickling sound of the creek that flowed through the woods, half remembering that a rustic wooden bridge crossed the creek at some point.

The flood and flow of instructions from the picnic spot stared to give way to rustle of creatures in the forest bed, to bids chirping in the tress above.

"You actually like the woods," she said out loud to herself, a habit she associated with her younger self. She had put that habit away recently now that she was properly older and talking to yourself was not proper.

She replied silently: Yes but that was before and this is now.

Regardless, she felt a flutter of excitement upon seeing the bridge, remembering when crossing that bridge meant crossing to a new world, a new land. Maybe one of the land's from Avalon's stories. There had been a period of time when Avalon's stories did come to life around her in places like that, places that seemed different from some other place.

She stopped in the middle of the bridge, crouching down to watch the rippling current pass under her. Small fish darted along the sandy bottom that glistened in the sunlight. She saw a turtle making its way across the creek, opposite of the direction she was heading in.

Pausing, she studied its slow, persistent motions, watched it kick and glide its way across the creek's current. It didn't move with great urgency, but it made its way.

Once the turtle disappeared in the brush lining the creek, the princess continued across to the other side. When her feet touched the ground again, she suddenly remembered a grove of old trees where she would spent hours as a little girl. She wondered if she could remember where it was.

Up to this point, she had been following a very rough narrow trail, probably made by the woodsman or maybe people long before them who had wandered these woods. She knew from Avalon that these woods weren't always part of the estate. But those times seemed as far removed as the far away worlds in Avalon's stories.

The grove she remembered wasn't on the trail. She thought she needed to strike off to the left at some point. As she walked, she remembered a series of mossy boulders that had been the marker for her to turn. There were the rocks just up ahead.

Even now she could picture herself walking into deepest parts of the forest, the tree cover getting thicker, the world feeling very far away. But something was different. The way up ahead seemed much lighter than before. Up ahead and to the right, she realized that a road had been cut into the woods.

When she reached the road, she stopped and stared down the ragged, turning path it made. She couldn't tell exactly where it went. But it cut in the opposite direction too, towards the grove. She turned and followed the road.

The road was littered with splinted and split wood. Much of it was still relatively bright and fresh looking. "This road is still new," she said out loud.

As she reached the road's terminal point, she gasped. She gasped because she was walking into a clearing, a clearing that she had never seen before now. This clearing wasn't a pleasant meadow full of weedy grasses and grazing animals. It was barren and stumpy, littered with the remnants of the trees that had been chopped down and taken away.

"They've cut down the trees!" she cried out, out loud again. She replied in her mind: Of course they did. Where do you think they get wood for furniture and other things in the world?

She knew the counterpoint she raised was a reasonable one, but the realization hurt nonetheless. Seeing these razed trees just added to the corded up frustration she was already carrying today. She dropped to her knees and started to sob, letting the angry, frustrated tears flow freely.

***

She cried herself dry, and just knelt in the clearing, holding her face in her hands until a voice sounded out, "Why are you crying? Are you okay?"

She stood up and circled around, scanning the clearing of the voice that called out to her. She didn't see anyone and wondered if in her her current state she was hearing things.

Then she heard a branch break and a figure stepped into the clearer. The figure was really nothing more than a child, a boy, younger than her by several years, wearing a thin robe. His head was shaved, but already covered in a scruffy stubble, and he held onto to a coarse sack slung over his shoulder.

"Are you sure you're okay? I heard you crying."

The princess wiped at her eyes and nose, self-conscious of the color that had probably spread over her cheeks. She could almost hear her mother saying, "That's an ugly look you've got. Cheer up, darling." "I'm fine. And even if I wasn't it isn't any of your business."

The boy looked at her, turned his head and shrugged. "Okay, it sounded like you were pretty upset. I thought an animal was caught in a trap. I heard you crying from far away."

"I said I'm fine. "Why are you here?"

The boy scratched his head and then looked up at the sky, "Well that's a big a question. I don't know that I have time to answer that. Let me see..."

She cut him off, "I would like to know who are. You're trespassing in the King's lands."

"I am?" The boy looked around puzzled. "That's great!" In his enthusiasm he started off across the clearing, marching right past her.

"Wait! Stop! Where are you going?"

"I'm crossing the clearing. I got lost and wandered around for a long time, just hoping that I would end up where I was told to go. I really hope I'm not late."

"Late for what?" she asked, but the boy had already disappeared into the wood. She took off after her, leaving behind the spectacle of her sadness and grief among the stubble and stumps in the clearing.

She had to keep a quick pace to keep up with him. "Stop, please, stop."

The boy stopped in his tracks and turned to her, finally allowing her to ask again, "Where are you going?

"Well, I'm really not supposed to say."

"So it's a secret."

"Kind of, yes. I would say it's a secret."

"What if I command you to tell me?"

The boy erupted in a laugh that doubled him over, "Command me? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. You can't command someone to tell a secret." Then the boy became reflective and stared at her intensely, "Can you?"

"Well I am a princess, so I believe that I can, yes."

"You're a princess? I've never met a real princess before." He started circling around her.

"There aren't any princesses where you're from, wherever you're from?"

"No, not that I'm aware. No princesses. There's are other people that give orders and tell others what to do, but no princesses."

"So I take it you're not one of these, how did you put it, 'people who tell other people what to do'?"

"Not really. Well, maybe... Not yet."

"What kind of answer is that? I'm completely confused by you. You are the most confusing boy I've ever met."

"I apologize. You're not the first person to say that to me."

Now that he was closer to her, the princess how tightly his skin stretched over his round face. The sun had turned his skin darker than hers. His finger nails were unkempt and dirty. He had a look of being generally disorderly and not well cared for.

And yet here he was wandering the world, wandering into her world, on the King's lands with some kind of secret purpose that he refused to share with her.

The boy's stomach grumbled, "I need to keep walking, I don't want to be late."

They started walking again, though the boy's pace was slower than before, "Are you hungry? Thirsty?" she asked him.

"I'm starving but I don't have time to waste. I made a promise and I have to keep that promise."

"But surely that promise should allow for tending to your basic needs. It doesn't sound like a very good promise that won't allow you to eat or sleep or other things to keep living. How will you fulfill your promise if you can't survive?"

"That's a good point. I really am hungry. Do you have anything to eat?"

"I don't..." the boy's face sank in disappointment, "But I know where to get food."

"Is it far away?"

"No it's very close."

"How close?"

"Just down this path. There is a another clearing, a proper clearing, along the creek."

"And there is food there? What kind of place is this? Is this a magical forest?"

"No silly, it's the King's Forest. The Eastern Forest to be exact. It's not magical, not in that way."

"Then why is there food just laying around in the woods? It's not just a bunch of mushrooms is it? I can't stand mushrooms. That's all I've eaten for days. That and a few birds eggs."

The princess tried to imagine this boy climbing up a tree to steal bird eggs. It was surprisingly easy to image this happening. "My mother is there, setting up a picnic. We brought too much food for just the two of it. You're welcome to some if it, if you'd like it."

"I would love that. Let's walk faster. Faster walking, sooner eating. That's my motto."

The princess assumed that it wasn't, in fact, his motto, but she smiled at the spirit anyway, and picked up her pace to try to stay abreast with the little boy who was barreling down the wooded path.

***

They startled her mother as they came crashing through the woods and entered the picnic spot. Her mother gasped, one of the servants nearly dropped a tray. The princess scanned the spot, only her mother, her mother's companion and the servant remained. The forestman and the warden were no longer part of the party.

"Darling, where have you been, and who in the world do you have with you?"

"I was wandering in the woods, just as you told me do." She decided not to share with her mother the news about the clearing at this time. "And this... This is..."

"Oh, my name is Leif," the boy said.

The princess nudged him and whispered, "Your majesty."

"But I'm not a majesty," the boy replied at full volume, clearly confused by what she meant.

"No, her, my mother. She's the queen. Say you're majesty and bow."

The boy's eyes were even wider than when he had learned she was a princess, "You're a queen. Pleased to meet you you're majesty. I've never met a real life Queen before."

"That's quite alright and to be expected," her mother replied. The princess was already annoyed at the tone that her mother was taking.

"Leif has been traveling and is hungry. I invited him to picnic with us."

"With us? Why I don't know dear."

The princess rushed forward she sat on knees before her mother, in a pose of daughterly pleading. "Please mother, he seems very good natured and so very hungry. Think of the good it will do."

It wasn't clear, even to her, what kind of good feeding the boy would do exactly, but she could see that her appeal to doing good in the world struck a chord with her mother. In a hushed tone her mother replied, "That is fine dear. We will make a place for him to eat, but over there."

"No! Mother! He must eat with us."

"I was hoping for a pleasant picnic with my daughter..."

"Mother..."

"Fine. Very well, I am much much too pliable a parent. Wouldn't you agree?" she asked her lady's companion, who nodded and replied with a terse, "Yes, my lady. But in bending, you model the true meaning of grace for your daughter."

"I had not considered it in that light." her mother replied. The princess know that her mother always looked positively on opportunities to school her in the correct courtly manner. Her mother's upbringing, by her own telling, had been marked by many such lessons and had led to her consider rise in station and status. Presumably she carried the same expectations for her daughter, to marry well and advance the family's name.

Her mother looked over her should at the boy and said, "Young man, my daughter says that you are hungry, please come join us for our picnic."

"I would love to!" the boy dashed forward, stopped himself, bowed in a halting way, and added, "Your majesty."

***

The boy was either masterfully evasive or much too hungry to answer questions in a clear manner. As they ate on the spread out linens covering the grass by the creek, they chattered and discussed and gossiped, but he remained very quiet. Not exactly quiet, the princess observed. He made a terrible ruckus and mess when he ate, in part because every bit he took had an attending commentary.

After several attempts to draw him out and reveal more details about himself, her mother finally gave up and turned her attention to her companion. The princess scooted herself closer to the boy so they could talk more privately without the adults overhearing what they were saying.

"Do you want to know why I was crying?" she asked him.

He took another bite of the cold roast quail and nodded his head, "Of course. I wouldn't have asked," he said through his bites of food.

"It was the trees."

"The trees?" he seemed puzzled. "I didn't see any trees."

"That's my point. That's why I was crying. That used to be a grove of very special trees, at least to me when I was younger. Now they're gone."

The boy had stopped eating, "What happened to them?"

"Cut down, I assume. Didn't you see the tree stumps and broken branches everywhere?"

"I was too distracted by your crying"

"That's not a nice thing to say."

"I didn't mean anything by it."

She settled the play of anger that crossed into her voice, "It's fine. I didn't know that the trees had been cut down. I was surprised, and I...I don't know, I just started to cry."

"Do you feel better?"

"I guess. I don't know. I would feel better if the trees had not been cut down."

The boy stared off past her at the creek as it bubbled along past them.

"What are you look at?"

"The creek. The water. Do you ever wonder if the water knows where it is going?"

The princess turned to watch the water. "I've never really considered it."

"It's carried along by something it doesn't really understand, but it keeps flowing, keeps being water either way."

The princess looked at him, not quite sure what the say. Where had this observation come from? He seemed so careless, even carefree about the world around him. She had spent countless hours watching these waters pass her by and had never thought anything like that before. He was the strangest little boy she had ever met.

***

The picnic was over and her mother announced it was time to return to the house. Returning meant starting the early evening rituals that took place before dinner. The princess knew that she had nothing to look forward to but another round of washing and dressing, being handled by her maid, a long dinner with any guests or courtiers were still lingering about the house. Then even an even longer time spent in the parlor with her mother and the other ladies.

She detested playing cards, and could only read for a brief time before the parlor's heat and the dull atmosphere put her to sleep. Then her mother would inevitably scold her for dozing off like a common laborer on the side of the road. "It is, and certainly will be, your duty to inject life and vitality into whatever situation you find yourself in. As the betters of so many, so many will look to you. You are a..."

Spark, madam," her companion would invariably interject.

"Yes, precisely. A spark. And those in your company are just cords of wood waiting to be lit by you. Don't you understand, dear?"

Some version of this conversation had played out so many time, so many nights. The princess could immerse herself in the scene just sitting her in the rattling carriage. The only thing that pulled her out of this reverie of tedium was listening to the boy's excited conversations from the outside the carriage.

Her mother refused to allow the boy the ride inside with them. "He is too common, darling. I simply cannot allow it."

The princess knew that her mother would not budge. Sitting together with the boy in the rustic woods, eating their rustic picnic was one matter. She could only imagine the scene of horror her mother conjured as she imagined returning home, exiting the carriage, and meeting the servants, whose job was the greet them and ease their way inside, and their puzzled look.

"He says he has somewhere to be and doesn't want to be late."

"While I commend the young man for wanting to be punctual, I hardly see how it is our responsibility to aid him with managing his time."

"Mother, you are taking this too literally."

"Literal? Well what other way is there to take it. I am merely responding to the situation you have brought before me, the exact one, unless you mean something else."

"No mother," she replied, huffing under her breath. She was already growing tired of debating this point with her mother.

Her mother's companion leaned in again and whispered something in her mother's ear. "Yes, yes, I suppose I could allow that. Fine, seeing as how today's themes seem to be grace and charity, we can permit him to ride atop the carriage."

She turned to tell the boy the good news, but suddenly couldn't find him. Maybe he had wandered off already. She paced around the picnic site, but found him sitting against a tree, starting to doze off.

She nudged his shoulder, "My mother says you can come with us. It's okay?"

The boy spoke through his yawn, "That's great news. Where are we going?"

"Home. To my home. I thought you said, you had somewhere to be. I thought you had some important secret appointment."

"Yes! and I can't be late. Does your carriage go fast?"

"As fast as a one horse carriage can travel on the roads we have this far out. Not fast, but fast enough."

"Well I can't complain. Besides I can hardly move a muscle after that lunch. I don't think I've ever seen that much food before."

Judging by the boy's look and how he had devoured so much food, the princess believed him.

"Darling, do close your sun shade," her asked. The princess realized that the late afternoon sun was starting to spread its bright light around them and through the carriage window on her side. She drew the shade, but not before realizing that they were close to home. They were crossing through one of the fields that was farmed. She could see lthe outlines of laborers in the fields swinging tools, stooping to pick and lift and drag.

With the shade drawn, the carriage was much darker. She leaned her head against the side of the carriage, closing her eyes to ride out the bumps and jostles until their day's journey ended.

Then she heard the driver call out and stern, "Whoa now." The carriage lurched to a stop.

"What's going on? Why are we stopping?" her mother asked.

The princess shrugged, having not more information that she did. She assumed that her mother was worried about bandits. She always fretted about bandits, even when they were traveling on their estate, on the King's lands.

She turned her head to the side of the carriage with the open window and suddenly met with the boy's upside down face.

"There are travelers up ahead, so we stopped."

The boy's face disappeared before he could hear her mother whisper to her companion, "Must be the priests. They typically arrive in a procession."

They sat still for several minutes in the middle of road. Suddenly she could hear horse hoofs pounded alongside then past them. The warden or forestman must be riding ahead. The travelers, even if they were priests, would have to give the right of way to the monarch's carriage, even though the monarch wasn't technically inside the carriage.

She could hear the reins crack and the driver give a little "Hiyah" Then they started to move again. As they approached the travelers, she peeled back the edge of the curtain to get a better look at the people who had parted to let them pass.

Much to her disappointment, though, she couldn't tell much about the figures lining the road. They were dressed in robes and many of them were hooded. They kept their heads low and faces out of site. Their robes were not uniform. Some were more or less plain than others. None were particularly lavish, nothing like her father's ceremonial robes.

She could only guess that these figures were in fact priests, the priests who had disrupted her day and kept her from Avalon. She didn't really know though, because she had never been allowed to see the priests up close before. And it had only been recently that she understood that there was some kind of connection between the priests and AValon.

The nature of that connection was a complete mystery to her. She never really considered why this connection was a myster. had someone forgot to tell her? Was she being lied to? Or had she just never stopped to think much about it.

Crosing through this parted stream of travelers though but the question at the forefront of her thoughts. But those forming thoughts were jostled out of her when the carriage came to a sudden halt. She pitched back into the cushions behind her. Her mother and her mother's companion lurched forward.

"Goodness, what is happening out there!?" her mother cried out.

"We're being stopped, my lady," the driver replied.

"Stopped by who?"

The driver didn't reply, or if he did, his response was drowned out by another voice. A loud, stern, deep voice that also cried out, "What were you thinking!? Get down from the carriage at once!"

The passengers in the carriage looked at each other, utterly confused. The princess pulled open the curtain, blinded momentarily by the surge of light that flooded in the interior. She poked her head out to see a tall man, one of the passengers, leading the boy away from the carriage, grabbing him by the collar, jerking along to the side of the road.

Moments later someone was rapping at the carriage door. Her mother's companion opened the door. The man she saw was now in full view, filling the door's frame.

He was severe and sharp angled. Old, but not weak like the old laborers and servants she was used to seeing. This man was old but vital. Regal, but not royal. She also noticed that his robes were much finer than many of the others she had seen. The also wore some kind of amulet close against his chest that peeked out from the tops of his clothes.

"Your majesty, allow me to apologize."

"High Priest, please explain yourself. I nearly suffered an injury for all of this jostling about on the road."

"Again, I apolgoize your majesty. There has been a most unusual occurance, a deviation from our forms and codes. Please be assured that the trangresser will be punished."

"Who are you talking about?" the princess interjected. Her mother was pleased.

The man locked eyes with her. In that moment, she could feel that she had been studied, ascertained. He nodded his head at her, "Your highness. We have only met through the stories the King and Queen have shared. I regret that our first meeting had occur under these circumstances."

"Please explain yourself," her mother cut in.

"The boy, the boy on our carriage. Where did you find him?"

"My daughter met him in the woods. He seemed like a troubled soul in need of nourishment and care. So we offered him our charity."

"A noble instinct, of course." Her mother's companion nodded knowingly at this comment. "But that...that boy isn't just a boy."

"Then who is he? Plesae do not leave us in the dreadful suspense," her mother replid.

"Of course. He is the newest, and youngest member, of my order."

The princess blurted out, "You mean he is a priest."

"That is exactly what I mean your highness. A priest of only a month, and still new, very new, to our ways, but a priest nonetheless."

Her mother chuckled, which seemed natural, if a little indecorous, "But he's just a boy!"

"Yes, I am afraid so. But the priesthood is in just a state these days that we must take the candidates we are given. He was the only candidate put forth by his people. But he should have known that we are charged with a solemn duty to perform and are not mingle with people of the world until that duty is discharged. I hesitate to say it, but he was put everything our duty bounds us to do at risk."

"Well, please know, that had I known, I...we would never have."

"Of course not your Majesty, please understand that I do not blame you. But I'm afraid we are losing day, and losing time. We have many tasks to perform, as you well know. We must be on our way."

"As must we, there are household matters to attend to."

"Very well. I take my leave and promise that the boy will not be a concern of yours anymore."

"I am pleased to hear it. Driver? Driver? Carry on and take us home, please."

The carriage starting rolling again. The princess fell back into her seat, still staring out the window. As they passed the contingent of priests, she could help but look for the boy. There he was, held in place by the High Priest's firm grip on his shoulder.

She caught his eyes just before they were too far out of sight. He looked as miserable as she felt right now.

# Chapter 2: The Space Between #

Dinner that night proved to be even more agonizing than usual. The princess made her appearance as she was obligated to do, at the time she was obligated to appear.

The only motivation she could muster inside was a strong desire to know if the High Priest would be a dining with them that night. She wasn't so much interested in the High Priest himself, though she was curious what her assessment of her had been, but wanted to hear more about the boy.

It would be right to say that she had been fretting from the time she returned home to the time she stepped foot in the long narrow dining room, but she could feel a constant tug of anxiety and concern in the back of her mind. That subtle yet gnawing sensation had made it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything and made time pass more slowly than usual.

The priests had vanished from view once they arrived on the grounds. She wondered where they could be going, and what important business they were attending to. As she had earlier in the day, she started to marvel over the fact that she either had never noticed, or never taken much interest in the contingent of robed figures who would appear at their house on some semi-regular basis.

Certainly she knew that the priests existed and knew that they were a very secretive order. She knew that her father relied on them in some capacity in his role as king, but she could not even begin to formulate what this interaction must look like.

Mulling over what little information she did have, she had decisively come to the conclusion that the little boy was an unlikely candidate to be a priest. The priests they passed on the road seemed so removed form life, so rigid and formal. The High Priest, in particular, seemed of this world, but also stood apart from it.

Perhaps that's why she wondered what he had made of her when he fixed his gaze upon her. She couldn't say it words, but instinctively knew that he was judging her by some criteria that she could not access and did not know, maybe could not know.

She wondered which parts of himself that little boy would have to trim away, like a gardener at a hedgerow, to become the kind of priest who wouldn't be pressed down by someone like the High Priest.

Once in the dining room, with the service about to being, she felt her interest in the proceedings diminish when she saw that the guests were just some minor official, a judge, and a some lesser nobleman and his wife.

Throughout the dinner she followed the protocols that she knew almost instinctively now. She feigned interest when it seemed that she should, and disengaged when it was clear the guests were speaking of subjects that didn't include her.

As the princess, the guests around her felt obliged to engage in some brief back and forth, which usually amounted to questions about her education or reading, or about the house and grounds. She wasn't inclined to talk much about the former, and didn't care to know much about the later.

So after a few awkward volleys, the guest would usually shrug and turn back to the table's conversation, satisfied that they had done their duty as guests in the King's house to engage his daughter. If nothing else, this would allow each on to say later over nightcaps or a game of cards, "Yes, a perfectly charming young woman. You must be so proud." At which point the adults would nod in agreement, and move on to other concerns.

Over the course of the service, she had become so lulled into the routine of feigning and disengaging that she didn't hear her mother addressing a direct question to her, something her mother rarely, if never, did in these formal settings. "Dear, remind us how you came across the boy."

Putting on her most agreeable princess demeanor, she replid, "The boy? Mother"

"Yes, the young priest. The judge was just asking about him, having heard previously before about the youngest priest to even be accepted into the order."

"Yes, I was telling your mother that if it weren't for the writings and decisions of one of most revered jurists of the last generation, the young man would not have been considered for the spot. Naturally, being a man of the law, I take great interest when legal theory materializes in the practical."

"We were in the eastern forest, as I'm sure mother has already explained. I was talking a walk. I came upon a grove I remembered visiting as a little girl. I was surprised to find that it had been cut down and the trees removed from the forest."

"What that old cyprus grove?" her father interjected. "We had those trees removed months ago. Had I known you had an attachment to the spot, I would have told your sooner."

She didn't care to hear more of an explanation about the trees and their fate. "Yes, father. As I said, I was surprised to see the trees gone and then there he was, asking me if I was okay."

"Why wouldn't you have been okay, dear?" her mother asked, but moved along the conversation when her daughter didn't reply. "You see the boy just wandered onto the estate. We had no idea who he was until we encountered the High Priest."

"The boy didn't tell you who he was?" the lesser nobleman asked.

"No, isn't that the strangest thing."

"In my limited experience, the priests observe their own ways closely, and care little for ours," the official said.

"My great-uncle was part of the priesthood, for a time," the nobleman's wife interjected. Even the princess knew that this nobleman's wife came from a disgraced family, so it was a surprise that she brought up and branch of it at all.

"Certainly my experience today has spoken to their strange ways," her mother concluded.

"You must remember my love that the priests bear a heavy burden and perform an important role. We must honor and respect their desire to protect their customs."

"But what will happen to him?" the princess blurted, almost interrupting her father, which was frowned up, especially during formal events like this, and around his subjects.

"Happen?" her father replied, tilting his head in confusion. "Why I suppose after the have finished their tasks that he will be punished."

The magistrate added, "The priests are known for their creative punishments."

"But why? Why punish him at all?" she cried out. "Did he really do anything that wrong? He's just a child."

"But, he is a priest," the magistrate replied. "His life is bound up with a different set of rules than ours. Those rules were broken. That is the logic that law follows...theirs and ours." The judge nodded his approval, affirming that the law did, in fact, work this way.

The princess tried to not be visibly upset. She could not tell how effectively she was doing this. Perhaps not that well. Her father stepped in to halt the conversation any further, "You must put this aside, it is no concern of ours what happens to this boy, this priest. Let us close this matter up."

"I agree," her mother added. "We need space between us and this unpleasant subject."

The princess knew she could not leave the table, not without breaching more protocol than she already did. She knew her father, who generally was an indulgent father, was barely tolerating her transgression just now.

***

The princess awoke the next morning to a dark room, even after the chambermaid had pulled back heavy curtains covering her windows. "It will be a gray day today, your highness," the maid commented.

The princess turned over in bed, shutting out the windows, and buried her head in her pillow. She opened one forcefully shut eye and saw the chambermaid's blurry outline standing alongside the bed. The chambermaid had her hands crossed, and very meekly said, "Should I have the house mistress tell your mother you're not well, princess?"

The princess closed her open eye, squeezed both tightly together, considered the matter, and said, "Yes, I'm not well this morning."

The chambermaid replied a soft, "Very well" and quietly left the room, leaving the princess to the silent contours of her dark, gray room.

She lost track of how long she lay there, tossing back and forth. She wasn't comfortable. It didn't feel like a luxury to be laying there broken out the household's pace. Her back ached and her head too. A daytime heat rose up through her body, which would have been pleasant during a nighttime chill, but now just irritated and agitated her.

She bolted up in bed just as her mother walked in with the house mistress. Her mother began buzzing about her room, making offhand observations, "I must come in your chambers more often...this table is much too shabby...make a note that we must replace these lamps with something else. I can't bear to look at them..."

The house mistress dutifully followed her mother, recording these observations in a notebook she kept around her neck, suspended him a braided silver chain.

They stopped at the foot of her bed. "Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better," her mother said. "I have very exciting news for you."

The princess rubbed her hands through the thick dark tangle of her hair. "What's the news?" She was already convinced that it wouldn't be exciting enough to rouse her out of her agitated state.

"The priests are completing their rituals and by all accounts they have been very successful." As she said this, the princess wondered what this meant, and if her mother knew what this meant. "So, your father, at my request, has approved hosting a ball, here, tomorrow night. We are already making plans. Invitations are being sent by couriers as we speak. Isn't this simply wonderful news? It's been far too long since we've hosted a ball."

The princess had vague memories of previous balls where she had been trundled around like a small object of great value, passed through the hands of visitors from different corners of the kingdom. Remarked upon, marveled at when she performed some cute trick that children inevitably learn to dazzle the adults in the room.

"And for you, darling, it's been much too long. I realize only now how cruel it has been to keep you out of society. Your father and I have been much too wrapped up in the kingdom's business. But that all changes, starting today." Her mother paused, "And listen, listen here. I promise you that will have more of my attention during this very important transition in your life. Not just your life. All of our lives. We need to properly introduce you to society and lay the groundwork for what comes next."

"What comes next?" the princess asked.

"Adulthood, marriage. Titles. Everything. Just as I experienced. You will experience, only on a much grander scale. I will be sure of that."

"Mother, it's too early to have my life plotted out for me. Can we wait until after luncheon?"

"Too early? It feels like we're positively wasting the day. Come now, it's time to get up. There's so much to do."

"Uggh, fine. But when can I see, Avalon? It's been far too long."

Her mother, who was about to leave her room, turned back and said in a feigned whisper, "Well, I wasn't supposed to say this, but there is a chance that you will be able to see Avalon at the ball."

***

Her mother kept her by her side for much of the day. Together they oversaw many of the preparations being made for the ball. Servants criss-crossed across the house, carrying linens, bringing fine wines from the cellar. Everywhere the princess looked servants were cleaning, dusting, polishing.

It had been several years since she had seen the ballroom, the topmost floor of the grand house's central wing. When she was much younger, her governess at the time would allow her to romp in the large space, lined with windows, when the weather didn't allow them to be outside.

Her governess at the time had extolled exposure to nature. Her mother had been reluctant at first, but came to understand that this method of education was becoming more fashionable among in the elites in the kingdom. Not wanting to be outdone, it seemed like there was a period of time when the princess lived much of her waking life outside.

It was also a period of time when she remembered Avalon truly entering her life, at least in a meaningful way. It was during these outdoor sessions that she had encountered Avalon with her governess, and formed an attachment to this person who had come to play such an important role in her life.

That governess had been released for some reason, the family's "relationship" as her mother had called it had come to an end. It was the beginning of a period of time when she saw Avalon more and governesses less. Occasionally a tutor in one subject or another would appear in her life, then readily disappear, partly due to the fact that she started to understand how to dispatch the people who were supposed to educate her, which then led to her having more time to spend in what ever way she chose.

The princess didn't feel that her education suffered much because of her tactics. She probably didn't grasp the subtleties of several dead languages, but she felt that she had learned so much about the world from Avalon. Besides, she wondered, certainly then, perhaps less so now, what a princess needed with stuffy tutors and their rote rehearsals of whatever subject matter they had mastered in their own youth.

Even though she had not been in the ballroom for years, it still seemed like a grand space. Though the weather prevented the space from being lit up and luminous with sunlight, the space still seemed large and took what light there was a turned it into magic. Even the columns of dust that swirled in the faint light seemed to glitter like a rare substance.

Perhaps it was a callback of her younger feelings about the space, about the governess, and Avalon, of those days when her life and, more importantly, her feelings about her life, were simpler, but she felt a ping of excitement course through her. She started to see the counters of the high vaulted ceiling in a different way, and could imagine the sounds of music and voices and dancing feet as they would curl about those vaults and resonate with a rich sound.

She started to trace out the lines in the intricate wooden floor, following the tracks of light and dark wood, hopping from diamond shape to square, with a combination of her natural and learned grace. The movement quickened her body, her cares started to feel further away. She begrudgingly admitted to herself that she was looking forward to the ball.

This excitement didn't completely blot out her concerns about the boy and her frustration over not seeing Avalon, but maybe the later issue would be resolved soon. As for the boy, perhaps, she started to argue with himself, he really did deserve any punishments that the priests administered. Maybe he had done something sever enough to deserve his treatment, or at least maybe she didn't know enough to say for sure.

This line of thinking took root in her mind as the day progressed, right until she was put into the hands of her mother's dressmaker. The dressmaker lived in a nearby village and been rushed to the estate to ready the Queen and Princess for the ball.

The princess spent several hours perched on top of a wobbling box in front of a mirror, twisting round and round. Pins seemed to thread in and out around her body at every imaginable angle.

It was too late to construct a new gown; so her and her mother would have to make due with taking a dress and altering it. In the princesss's case, the servants were able to bring down from storage several gowns that the princess had never worn, did not even recognize. Her mother, apparently, had been buying gowns for her without her event realizing it, storing them for an occasion when she might need them.

The dressmaker had to mend to dress to make it fit properly. Then she began ruching and pleating, pulling and pressing to change the dress' look. "And you're sure this is the style now?"

"Yes, my lady. I make it a point to keep up with the evolution of styles around the capital. Knowing that I may be called on in a situation exactly like this one."

The dressmaker's reply gave her mother great satisfaction. Her mother often bemoaned being so far from fashionable life in other parts of the kingdom. They spent so much of their time on her father's estate, where he preferred to spend his time. Because of this, the estate became the de facto court, and life in the kingdom shifted accordingly. At least this was the explanation that her mother would give when she was lamenting this facet of her life. "Not that I am not extremely privileged in other ways," her mother would add, not completely unaware that the Queen enjoyed privileges that many others did not.

***

By the next day, the princess' mood and outlook had changed considerably. She was genuinely looking forward to the ball, though not particularly keen on her mother's constant allusions to her entering society. One the thing the princess did not want was to feel that this society's eyes were watching her every move. She didn't feel ready to address herself to this being, this thing that her mother portrayed as being everywhere and everything all at once.

The princess felt that she was excited on her own terms. Not society's. Not her mother's. So she would enjoy the ball for what it was. By tomorrow, much of the turmoil she experienced the last few days would feel like a distant memory. The only problem she faced now was that the evening couldn't come soon enough.

Her mother did not want the princess with her like she did yesterday. This actually came as something of a relief, because her mother was controlled by her nerves now. Everything seemed to be teetering on the edge of disaster or coming together better than she could have hoped. She watch her mother bound these hills of despair and elation, being totally ignored by her, several times before she decided to slip away and roam the gardens outside.

The sun was shining again. The air was starting to feel cooler and crisp, but it was still warm enough to enjoyed ambling through the gardens.

She walked aimlessly for a while before deciding to walk by the hothouses where the gardeners cultivated flowers. Her father took a great interest in cultivating flowers, even hosted several competitions for other like himself. Even though he inevitably won these competitions, he was so deeply interested in the subject, that he barely seemed to notice that he had won. His inattention to this fact made the event tolerable for the other participants.

As she crossed the lawn to the hothouse, she realized that she would ask for help assembling a bouquet for Avalon, for when she saw her finally. She knew that Avalon loved flowers. When she would walk with Avalon and the governess, they would often steer their course to the hothouse to admire what was growing there.

She entered through the metal and glass door, letting the heat and humidity inside envelope her. She had almost felt chilly walking outside before entering. Now her clothes started to feel heavy and awkward. One of the gardeners greeted her. She started to approach him to make her request, but then noticed an unexpected figure down at the opposite end deeply examining the plants there.

The princess told the gardener she would return and walked closer to the figure, who she realized was the High Priest. She would not have assumed that a person like this would be admiring flowers the way he was.

The high priest looked up and noticed her before she could acknowledge him, "Ah, your highness. I didn't know that you were interested in the gardening and flowers."

"I was just passing through really...to ask the gardeners to cut a bouquet of flowers for me."

"Ah, yes, of course. Cut flowers do make for a pretty sight in one's room."

She felt dismissed by this remark and it bothered her. Why did this high priest seem to treat her like some kind of object under glass, something to be observed and commented upon? Was she doing something to invite this scrutiny?

"They do, but these are not for me."

The high priest leaned forward to more closely examine one of the flowers before him, he breathed in the flower's fragrance more deeply. "Who are they for?"

This seemed like a very forward question, but she felt compelled to answer him, to justify herself for some reason. "For my friend, for Avalon."

"Avalon? Do you see her often?"

"Not as much any more. But whenever I can, I visit with her."

"And the King and Queen approve of these visits?"

"I suppose they do." She decided to counter with a bold question of her own, "Why are asking these questions."

The High Priest drew up to full height, breathing in the air around him with a deep satisfied gulp. "Amazing isn't. So many flowers in this hothouse, so many fragrances, all releasing their scents into their air, all blending together. And yet I can still identify the scent of this flower here, it smells so particular and it lingers. And yet this flower, this particular species relies on..." he scanned the area around them then pointed out another type of flower, "...that one in order to pollinate and survive. So unique, yet so bound to what is around it."

He looked around, taking note of the workers in the hothouse that were nearby, "Please come walk with me." They left the hothouse with him guiding her by the arm, not forcefully, but his will seemed to channel itself through his touch. There was no mistaking that she was supposed to follow him and his direction. "I want to show you something."

They walked into one of the small orchards of fruit trees that had been planted generations ago. Another priest stood at the edge of the orchard, seemingly standing watch. The High Priest passed him without acknowledging him at all.

The princess tried to catch the priests' attention, trying to get some piece of information to orient herself with. But, much like on the road before, the priest keep his eyes concealed, unmoved by whatever wild look of desperation might have passed her face.

The trees never bore much fruit, just enough for pleasant fall time snacks. Most of the fruit had been harvested weeks before, leaving only the smell of sweet sour rotting fruit. She had to hop over the mushy masses that were left, even after the pigs had routed through the remains.

The walked to the center of the orchard. As they grew closer, she could hear faint groans. Then she saw the boy laying on his side, clutching his stomach, groaning. She tried to rush forward to tend to him, but the priest's firm hand held her back.

"No, this is his punishment." She looked up at him. "Did you think he would be lashed or stoned. No, he is a priest, not a common criminal, but he needed to be punished."

"What did you do to him?"

"He was made to eat these rotted apples until I deemed he had enough."

"But he's sick now. He looks miserable."

"Yes and hopefully this young boy will carry this lesson forward with him."

"And that lesson is?"

"As priests, we are of this world, but not a part of it. We stand a part from it. And must not break that vow."

"Why is this code so important? What does it matter?"

"That is a question that I cannot answer here. But I will say this. When I look at you, I see a young person, on the verge of adulthood, full of so much potential..."

She must have given him a surprised look, because he stopped and added. "Yes, princess, I see potential in you, potential to be a great monarch, a wise ruler. But I also see currents in you that trouble me. I would never want the monarchy and priesthood to come into conflict. That would upset long standing understanding. You, this boy, even Avalon, yes, your precious Avalon, all have a role to play in that understanding, even though you don't realize it yet."

"I can't say more, but know that your actions from today forward, have great import, more meaning than you may realize. So the next time you meet one of my priests in a forest clearing, do not invite him to picnic, no matter your personal feelings. Your personal feelings are like these rotted apples to a priest, only foul spoilings that will leave us sick and twisted, not like a priest at all. Do you understand?"

The princess nodded, wincing slightly under his grip, which never loosened from her shoulder, and maybe even grew tighter as he delivered this speech or warning or threat to her.

***

She thought about the High Priest's speech as she prepared for the ball. Her maid asked her several times if she was feeling any better. "I'm fine, thank you," was her curt reply.

She hoped that the boy would be okay and would recover from his punishment. She supposed that being forced to eat rotten apples would make him sick, but surely he would recover.

More than this, she puzzled over what the priest said about roles and connections between things. How could her world be connected to his at all?

Another train of thought nagged at her concerning Avalon. For the past several years, Avalon had been such a fixture in her life. Avalon would come and go, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time. She never really explained where she had gone or what she had done. These trips, however, never interrupted their afternoon walks, or rainy mornings spent in Avalon's rooms listening to stories.

Yet recently the space between them seemed to widen. Most recently Avalon had been missing for over a month, the longest time the princess remembered her being gone for. And now she desperately wanted to see her, and she was only a few hours away from doing so.

Her anticipation and longing helped soften her attitude and tolerate her maid's meek ministrations that her maid delivered. Finally the last of the rings was set on her slender fingers and the maid stepped away to let the princess admire herself in the mirror.

The princess held out a hand, asking without words, to be helped up out of chair. She walked over to the mirror to fully asses herself. The dressmaker had made the dress more presentable, perhaps the detailing along the bodice was a little fussy and distracting. The princess did prefer plain, but well made things, but she could not argue that the gown had a certain fit and finish.

She twirled side to side several times trying to assess the gown's full effect. Finally pleased by what she saw, she said to her maid, "You may leave now."

The maid curtseyed and took her leave to join the other servants as they made their final preparations for the ball. The princess remained in her room, pacing nervously hoping that the hour would arrive when something could actually happen, instead of endlessly waiting for it to happen.

Finally someone knocked on her door. It wasn't a knock she was used to, perhaps a new servant. She said loudly, "Come in."

She did not expect to see her father standing in her doorway. He was medium height, but looked like a strong man, even when just a dark outline in the doorway.

"Father?" I didn't expect to see you there. The princess made a deferential bow to him.

"I didn't mean to surprise you. I thought I should take this opportunity to escort you down to the main hall where we will receive our guests."

She smiled at her father and said, "I would like that."

Her father, the King, was a serious man, took his role as King seriously. He diligently read his briefings and documents, responded promptly to his councillors, weighed matters of state deliberately, and so on.

In her mind, he was a good kind, the model of a king. He could be inflexible and unbending, but she assumed this would be the case for her if she were ever monarch. No one to say know to you. How did he manage to maintain his sense of proportion about things? Rather than being swept up in the trappings of his station, he seemed to accept things as matter of fact, and work hard to ensure their presense in his and his children's lives.

They walked together down her wing of the house to the where the grand central staircase rose to unite the various parts of the house. At this point, her father was mostly silent, having used up all of the small talk he had stored up to use with her. Typically in these situations, he wouldn't know what to say and would prefer to be silent than the say frivolous words.

In this way, she thought, her father and mother seemed like such opposites, such an unlikely pairing. But she remembered that often in their royal lives forces beyond their control could end up shaping what, for other people, were deeply personal decisions. Not so for them. Or so she had been told.

***

Despite the ball being announced in such a haphazard way, the guests seemed too numerous for the princess to count. She was able to recall or remember the first handful of guests that arrived. After that, she lost track of the faces, the dresses, the compliments.

Much to her mother's delight there was small selection of eligible matches for the princess to engage with during the night. Some a little younger than herself, most significantly older. Regardless of their status or disposition towards her and the prospect of wooing her, each became a willing dance partner for a turn or two, before swirling off to engage in other pursuits.

During much of the ball, the guests crowded the edges of the ballroom, while the dance floor saw a steady flow of gowns and long tailed coats, feet tapping and scraping their way across the intricate patterns in even more intricate patterns of arched arms and sweeping legs.

Half way through, the princess had to take a break. She was flushed and could feel sweat starting to roll down the angles of her shoulder blades. She sat and felt content and chatted merrily with the guests around her.

She knew that her mother was very satisfied with her comportment and bearing. She caught her mother chatting with the coteries of ladies around her, each one nodding approvingly in her direction. Each one had been in a situation similar to hers at some point. She could only imagine the stories and memories they were sharing and reliving together in that huddle of finery.

The musicians began to play again and dancers found partners and began to assemble on the dance floor. The tune and tempo dictating a line dance, with the dancers pairing up as they criss crossed the floor, then remerged back in to the line.

As the princess took her place in the line of other ladies dancing this round, she could hear the mood of the room shift. Somehow, all at once, everyone's attention shifted to a new center of gravity. The princess looked around to understand what was distracting everyone from the dance floor, which normally was the center of attention for a ball.

Then she realized what had happened. She realized the moment that she brought her own attention back to the lines before her and looked across to see an unlikely dance partner. The king had joined the dance, standing directly across from her.

The tittering and talk in the room caused the musicians to stop their tunings momentarily. The king, smiling generously at the all of the attention washing over him, gestured for the room to quiet down, which it did almost immediately. He nodded to the lead musician. The musicians harmonized their instruments and began to play.

The music moved at a brisk pace. It had intricate timing, and sometimes the tempo would change suddenly, signaling a new formation or movement in the dance. Dancing in this way required the dancer's complete concentration to fully appreciate the directions being give them.

The musicians were skilled enough to not just blindly lead the dancers along, but to respond to the dancers as well. A couple who seemed too attached might cause a rapid shift in the music to indicate that it was time to pair up again, or another pairing might catch and hold the room's attention, causing the musicions to stretch out the theme a little longer.

Certainly, they responded to the moment when she finally crossed paths with her father. The music seemed to change entirely, signaling that they would be dancing with these partners for a while. Indeed, every eye was on them as they held their dancing poses, bowing, dipping, and crossing each other in time with the music.

Her father almost seemed indifferent to the fact that they were dancing together. But the music sped up again and they started to travel the dance floor at a steady trotting pace. The music slowed again with them in the center of the room.

Her father leaned in and whispehred to her, "I'm glad we were given this moment to speak. I have something important to say to you."

Her father's whispered seemed to push the room's clatter and chatter away. She was focused solely on his voice, the music, and making her body move along as the music required.

The made a few more rounds before he leaned in again and said, "Avalon will not be attending the ball. And I have been told that you are not allowed to see her any more."

He twirled the princess away from him and then back towards him. She tried to master the fire in her face, but he must have seen some of it. "I know you are upset, but do try to enjoy the rest of tonight."

The music ended and the dance was over. She pulled away from her father, walking stiffly towards the ballroom entrance. People leaned in and told her how beautiful she looked and how splendid it was to see her dancing with the King.

The princess blankly smiled and nodded, consumed by what her father had just said. Had she heard him correctly, "never see Avalon again." And he said he had been told, told by who? The princess assumed she knew the answer to that question. She was sure the High Priest was behind this, though she couldn't fathom why his opinion had such sway over the king, her father.

She must have been leaning against the doorframe, looking faint. Her mother approached her and said quietly, "Are you feeling well? You look ghastly right now."

"I'm...I'm feeling overheated, that's all."

"A drawback from not wearing gowns often enough, I'm sure." Her mother replied. The princess studied her closely and saw a look of real concern in her mother's eyes that expressed something very different from her proper response to her daughter's condition. "Perhaps you should step outside and get some fresh air."

"Yes, yes, I should..." the princess replied, starting the walk briskly down the short hallway that led to the grand stairs that wound their way back down the ground.

# Chapter 3: Avalon #

She wandered outside into the crisp evening air. As she stumbled around the grounds, she grew more and more angry about what happened during the dance. She wondered if her father had chosen that exact moment in the midst of this dance, in the midst of the spectacle that he created, with all eyes on them, to deliver this news to her.

He must have known that she wouldn't take the news well, and tried to blunt the impact by staging this scene. She always assumed that her father was  too interested in the the business of being a king, or or his unusual pursuits, like cultivating flowers, to care much for crafting elaborate facades like this. She thought that he was as he appeared to be, slightly removed from daily life, the Diving King.

She tried to imagine never seeing Avalon again, and a chill rippled up through her body, causing her to skip a step and stop where she was. She wanted to start sobbing, ugly tears that her mother wouldn't approve of, but didn't. She just trembled with cold and range, stood in place, staring up at the darkening night sky.

As she stood there, she heard a faint coughing sound in the distance. She realized it was coming from the orchard and wondered if it was the boy still there working off the effects of eating so many rotten apples. Maybe he still needed help. Maybe there was something she could do to correct something, even a little thing, when everything felt off kilter and broken inside her right now.

She crept carefully towards the orchard. Thankfully, she didn't see any priests stationed around the orchard keeping watch, so she proceeded quietly towards the spot where she had last seen the boy.

In that same space in the middle of the orchard, now flooded with moonlight, she found him sitting, propping himself up agains the rocks. His head flailed from side to side and he kept his knees pressed up tight against his stomach.

She gathered up her gown around her and knelt down, carefully to do so on the opposite side of where he obviously had been throwing up earlier. She reached out a hesitant hand and rested it on his shoulder.

He didn't acknowledge her at first, so she gave his shoulder a little shake. "Are you okay?" she asked.

The boy looked at her from the corner of his eyes, and rested his head on his arms, crossed over his knees. "You shouldn't be here," was his only reply.

"It's okay. I want to be sure you're okay. I feel terrible that I didn't come find you sooner."

The boy looked up at her. His thin face seemed darker, more ghostly in the moonlight. She could hardly imagine the vibrant boy who had picniced with her just days before.

She scooted herself next to him, rested her back against the stones where he sat. The boy rested is head on her shoulder. She almost refused the gesture; it was so ingrained in her that common people, probably even priests, weren't to lay hands on her in this way. But as they sat there, she could feel the anger and angst that was gurgling inside her settle. She felt almost at peace, for a moment.

The boy started to whimper, moan, like his stomach was hurting again. He muttered out, "It's terrible. So terrible."

"I know. They shouldn't have punished you at all. I don't understand..."

The boy sat upright, his eyes wide like some kind of urgent spirit possessed him. He looked straight in her eyes, "No, not that. The rituals. What we did, what we do. As priests. I couldn't bear it. It was awful. I never want to do it again. I wish I wasn't a priest."

"Then don't be," the princess said, mustering bravery for someone else. "Leave, run away. I can gather supplies for you. You won't go hungry."

The boy stood up now, as if he was taking her advice. "No you don't understand. How can I make you see." When he said that word, he shuddered, seemed on the verge of being sick again. "I am marked down. I am a priest for life. There is no escape. Besides, I would shame my family. It wouldn't be fair to them."

Now the princess was standing too. She gripped by him the shoulders, "But how can a child, a boy bear so much? How can they ask you do that?"

The boy shrugged, "I don't know. They did though. And I'm here. And now I can't unsee what I've seen." He looked down at his hands, "Can't undo what I've done."

The princess turned away, wanting to march off and leave this frustrating conversation behind her, leave everything behind her. She took a few steps and said, "I'm so tired. I just want to see Avalon and feel better. She always makes me feel better."

"Avalon? Did you say Avalon? How do you know Avalon?" the boy said, a new urgency in his voice.

"I've...I guess I've always know her, as long as I can remember. She is my fried, my companion. She is...my everything."

"She's a monster and what she does it monstrous. And I am a part of it now. I can't believe this. I can't believe you are friends with her."

"Avalon is not a monster. That's a terrible thing to say. Take it back."

The boy stepped towards her. He was smaller than her, but tried to assert himself, "You musn't see her anymore. You don't understand how terrible it all is."

"What? Why won't anyone tell me. I don't understand."

The boy looked possessed again, "Then you've never seen the eyes. No,  you haven't. You could't have. Otherwise you would know."

"I've seen Avalon's eyes. They're grey and soft like pearls."

"Not those eyes. Not them." The boy looked over his shoulder. "Quiet, she's here. We must go."

He started to dash away. She tried to reach out for him, to catch him before he ran away in this feverish state. He must be sick and its affecting his mind, she thought. What other explanation was there for it?

The boy escaped her easily, and disappeared into the orchard and the dark tree cover. Soon, she had no sense of where he was going. But she knew he was right that someone was approaching, but must have retreated. Had Avalon overheard their conversation? What horrible things she might have heard them saying?

The princess struck out into the night to try to find the figure, hoping, wishing that it was in fact Avalon who was out walking on a night like this. It wouldn't have been unheard of for her to do such a thing.

In her wanderings, she approached the hothouse again. She went inside, thinking she had seen a figure inside, a slip of a shadow, maybe nothing more.

She paced up and down a few rows of flowers. Then she saw before her, as if appearing out of nowhere, Avalon approaching her. She moved silently and slowly towards her, seeming to walk more like an apparition than a person. She seemed to communicate so much sadness in just the way she walked.

"Princess? What are you doing out so late?" Avalon asked her.

The princess rushed forward, propelled by relief, and wrapped Avalon up in her arms. She didn't notice at first how frail and thin the body she embraced was. But Avalon seemed to falter under the pressure of her arms, the weight of the emotion surging from her.

The princess her her go and started talking quickly, "Avalon! I'm so happy to see you. They wouldn't let me see you. My father said I could never see you. And there was a boy, he turned out to be a priest..."

"Slow down, princess. We have time. Some time to catch up. But we can't talk here, it is too dangerous. Can you come to my room at the stroke of midnight?"

"Sneak out of my room?"

"Yes, it's the only way."

"I can do that," the princess replied.

"Good, perhaps this will help settle everything," was Avalon's cryptic response.

They walked back out into the gardens, then parted company at a long path lined with trees. Avalon walked down the long path until it veered out of site. Surely she had some way to creep back into the house.

The princess turned back to the house too, retracing the rounding way she got here. She went directly to her room and told her maid curtly that she wasn't feeling well when the maid tried to stop her in the long hall before her room.

***

"You looked so grown up in your gown tonight," Avalon said after they had both settled on a cushioned seat at the window. The princess could feel cold air coming in through the small gaps in the glass panes. She felt chilled at first, but shrugged it off. "I wished I had been able to see you at the ball."

The princess looked down at her nightgown, half expecting to be still wearing her fancy dress. Even now, the ball and the dancing and the fine gown seemed very far away. She almost had forgotten that she was dressed in a fine dress, forgotten that she was traipsing around outside in the folds and ribbons and ruching. She hoped that the dress wasn't ruined, but pushed the thought out of her mind.

She look up at Avalon, who was still a head taller than her, even when sitting. "I want to know everything. I want to hear everything. Where have you been? Tell me your stories."

Avalon smiled a distant, sweet smile, a vacant smile that the princess was not used to seeing. She was used to Avalon being very present, very much there before her. But tonight she seemed far away, tired. Very tired.

"Everything? I don't think we have time for everything," Avalon replied, a gently laugh dancing across her soft melodic voice. "And maybe not times for stories either."

"No stories?"

"Maybe not tonight."

"Avalon," the princess asked, her tone changed to a more hesistant one, "is everything okay."

Avalon's long fingers embraced her cheeks and she said to the princess pointedly, "Everything is as it should be."

"Then why do you seem do different. Not like yourself."

"That is what I want to talk to you about."

"I want to know everything."

"Princess, if I could tell you everything, I would. I shouldn't be telling you what I'm about to say. I shouldn't even be out right now."

"It's those priests, isn't it. Are they hurting you?"

"No, no princess. They are performing their duty. Just as I am performing mine. It's a duty that I have carried out for a long time, since you were just a baby, and now my time to carry out that duy is coming to an end."

The princess considered this piece of information, turned it around in her thoughts, "I don't understand."

"I know you don't, dear princess. I don't want you to understand. I want you to stay just I remember you. I want to remember our days together for ever."

"Please, Avalon. I'm not a child. Stop speaking to me like I'm a child. I want to understand. I deserve to understand. Everyone keeps talking about duties and ceremonys and sacred codes. Everyone seemes to be tied up in things they eithet don't understand or are too big for them to even talk about. I'm tired of it. I just want to know."

Avalon looked at her intently, "You are right, princess. You are not a child anymore. I find myself forgetting the fact. You're growing up quickly. I feel that I have missed it, that it slipped past me."

"But I'm here now."

"Yes, that is true." Avalon stopped and looked out into blank dark window. "Maybe there is time for one more story. Have I told the story of Griselda?"

"I don't think so."

"Well then, this is the story of Griselda:"

"Griselda was a woman who had lived many, many years ago in a small mountain village. She was a hearty woman and outlived her relatives, including her husband and her children. She became increasingly difficult to live with, so the villagers forced her to move further down the mountain."

"At this point, Griselda was tired of the villagers and their small complaints. So she was happy to move. She took her chickens and goats with her and found a new place to settle. In fact, she found an old tatched hut that had been adanboned. It seemed for a long time, because evertyhing needed cleaning and repairing. But Griselda had nothing but time, so she set to work."

"Many years passed and the villagers had nearly forgotten about Griselda. Some of the villager elders would recount some argument she had gotten into a local magistrate or some other exploit that confirmed for everyone, even those that could hardly remember her, that they were better off with her out of their lives."

"In those year, Griselda didn't think much time about the villagers either. Instead, she had become preoccupied with a book that she found hidden in the thatched hut, buried under the dirt floor. She happened upon it one day when she was removing old leaves and straw to place new straw on the floor."

"The book was full of strange writings and symbols. It was a book of magic. Griselda, like many of us, didn't believe in magic, but she was interested in this book. It appealed to her that, in her solitude, she should come to understand and master secret knowledge that would set her apart form others, particuarly the nasty villagers who had driven her from her home."

"Little did Griselda, or the nasty villagers know, but this was a time of war in the land. The kingdom did not exist and lords battled with each other for territory. There was terrible battles in those times. Sometimes whole villages would be burned to the ground, their inhabitant impressed into the service of the conquering lord."

"Such an army was making it way to the mountains, to Griselda's hut and her former village. She was the first to be introduced to this particular lord and his soldiers. They stormed into her hut in the night, seized her animals and the meager stores of food she kept, and continued on their way."

"In her anger, she turned to her spell book for comfort, she landed upon a spell, one that she had been studying for some time. It required casting a spell on a cloak, a very special cloak, a cloak it just do happened that she was been working on for some time.""

"She spent the rest of the night hastily finishing the cloak. In the morning, she put the cloak on and enchanted it with the spell in the book. Her work done, she followed the trail of destruction that the lord's army left. It led her to her old village."

"As she entered the village, she could not comprehend the destruction. Griselda, along with her fellow villagers, had lived an isolated and relatively peaceful life. They tithed to a lord who sent representatives to collect was was due to him, but otherwise were left alone."

"So Griselda had not seen a battlefield, and the village looked like a battlefield now. Every where she looked was death and destruction. She walked through the village, taking it all in, but not just with her eyes."

"She didn't realize it at first, but the enchanted cloak had come alive and was watching and remembering as well. For you see the cloak she had created was embroided with eyes, hundreds of eyes, looking in all directions. The cloak would grant the wearer the ability to see and remember all that crossed its path."

"Griselda finally caught up with the army, wearing her cloak, and recording incredible scenes of destruction and havoc. The eyes on the cloak were wide open, and observing everything. When the lord's army saw Griselda and her cloak, they took this to a be a bad omen, a portent of their impending destruction. The lord's army fell apart as soldiers deserted, slaves escaped, and the will to fight and destroy left them as well."

"That is the story of Griselda's cloak," Avalon concluded.

"That story seems familiar, but I'm not sure," the princess said.

"Yes, many children across the kingdom hear some version of it. You may or may not hear the name Griselda. The story's location may change. The story may not reference the cloak, but I have told it as truly as I know how."

"You've never told me that story before," the princess said. "Why?"

"I don't know. Perhaps it felt like it would reveal too much about myself. Perhaps I didn't want to tell it for that reason. Besides, you always seemed to enjoy stories about the world as it is today much more."

The princess considered this and decided it was probably true. She replid, "If this story took place so long ago, then what does this it have to do with anything?"

Avalon stood up, crossed her room and stopped before a large wardrobe. She opened the door and removed something, draping it over her arm. It was too dark to tell at first what it was. But Avalon walked back closer to her, closer to the lamp light, but she stopped several arms length away.

"It has everything to do with me, and with this. This is Griselda's cloak and I am its current wearer."

"So you are Griselda now?"

"In a manner of speaking, yes. I'm Avalon, of course, but that wasn't always my name."

"What is your name?"

"I don't recall. I remember so much. I see so much and yet I don't recall my real name. Everyone who wears this cloak is given a name. You are not the same person once you being to wear it. The things you do and see are no longer your own."

"Then who do they belong to?"

"The King. The priests. The people. All of them to some degree. So much of what we share, the stories we tell, come from the things I've seen, and others before me, have seen while wearing this cloak." Avalon paused. She studied the cloak for a moment, then returned it to the wardrobe. "But my time wearing it is coming to an end. And soon I must leave."

"Leave? Why? Where? For how long?"

"Forver, princess. I must leave forever. I have reached the point in my journey, in my time with the cloak when I must leave."

"Avalon, I don't understand."

Avalon sat again on the window seat. As she did, the princess noticed how frail Avalon seemed. Her face seemed older now, her eyes less vibrant. When she sat, she wrapped her arms around herself, as if keeping out cold, but did so gingerly, as if not resisting her own touch.

"Griselda, did not realize when she cast that spell that it contained a curse hidden inside its words, buried among the letters and sounds. When she cast that spell, she also cast the curse. And the curse she cast wasn't on own self, it was cast on the cloak and it resides in the cloak."

"So you have been cursed too?"

"Yes, from the moment I first wore the cloak, the cursed passed to me, just as it passed to all the women who wore it before me."

"Can't you reverse it? Or..." the princess's mind raced through possibilties, "if you stop wearing it now and destory it, will the curse be broken."

Avalon replied, resignation tinged in her voice, "There are stories, only known among the women who wear the cloak, stories I cannot share in great detail, of previous weaers having tried all of those things. Even unspeakable things, some of which led to the wearer taking her own life."

"That's terrible. Didn't you know this when you put the cloak on? Why didn't refuse."

"Becuase when you are asked, you don't refuse. That is how the cloak is passed down, how it always has been."

"Asked? Then you had a choice?"

"Princess, no there was a no choice. I was asked and I wore the cloak."

"Who asked you?"

"The king, of course. The wearer serves the king or queen, who rules this land. That is why I live here, housed and protected by the King. I wear the cloak because the King asked and to be asked is to not refuse."

The princess's mind was swirling with even more thoughts, suddenly her family, her story, was bound up in this terrible thing happened to the person she loved most dearly in the world. How could this be? What could she do? She got up and started towards the door, "I will wake my father up at once and demand that he release you from this bond. Demand that you be allowed to stay. Please stay, Avalon."

Avalon stood too and approached the princess, embracing her in a warm hug. The princess drew away quickly because she could tell that Avalon was wincing with pain. "You're hurt. What's wrong."

"It's the curse. I bear it with me always. It has gotten worse too."

"Let me see, I need to see," the princess replied.

Avalon hesitated, but then she shifted a sleeve from her gown down off her shoulder, revealing frail looking skin and bones, but skin covered in something, like sores or bruises. The princess stepped forward to see better. No, not bruises, eyes. Her skin was covered in eyes like those on the cloak, eyes that were blinking and moving and searching. Eyes that were remembering, even now, even in this moment, recording.

The princess recoiled, thinking of the boy and his terrified cry that Avalon was a monster. She couldn't think of her as being a monster, never could do that, but understood now how that energetic boy and had been consumed by visions of eyes.

"Your skin..." the princess said, as if just making words for their own sake.

"Yes, you understand the curse now. The cloak granted its wearer with the ability to see and rememeber. And the priests learned how to extract those stories so they could be saved and shared. But eventually the wearer would not be able to escape the impossible burden of seeing so much."

Exhauseted already, Avalon sat in a nearby chair. "At first the priests could keep the eyes from spreading, were able to harvest their visions, but the eyes grew too numerous and resistant to their rituals. And now, I can no longer bear it, I can no longer bear witness to anything more. So I must retire and disappear from this world."

"Where will you go?"

"There is an island in the sea, the tide carries the sea there. It is our retreat, our refuge when this moments occurs."

"You've been there?"

"No, but I am aware. I have seen the memories. In fact, I have experienced all of the departures. Some were pleasant memories, others I would never want to revist."

"When do you leave?"

"Tomorrow, princess. We leave for the coast in the morning. And set sail the next day. Preparations are already being made."

"And then you will be gone."

"Yes, I will fade away into the memories and stories."

"And there will be another like you?"

"Yes, that is the custom. Another like me. And then after that and it will continue on."

"Aren't you angry? Aren't you upset."

"Why, princess? I was chosen to perform a duty, a most important duty that few are called to do. I spent much of my life witnessing the more important deeds of this age, meeting the most important people. Meeting people like you, like your governess... Of course, I haven't forgotten her. But then again, I forget so little."

They both sat silently until Avalon said in a near whisper, "I'm afraid that I have used what little energy I have. I know I have shared so much with you. More than I should have. More than I was able ever to do. But I must go to bed, and you must return to your room before you are discovered. This may be our last moment together, princess. My only regret is that I will have no memories of the person you will become. I has hoped for so long that I would get to meet that person eventually."

***

When the princess awoke the next morning, her mother was in her room. Not sweeping through and making pronouncements. She was sitting on the edge of the princess' bed. The princess sat up and said in a sleepy voice, "Mother?"

"You're awake. Good."

"Why are you here?"

"I want you to get dressed. There is somewhere important you need to be."

"Where do I need to be?"

Her mother looked at her. The princess was surprised by how tired and careworn her mother's eyes seemed to be. "Avalon is leaving. She is leaving this morning. Your father told me earlier."

"I know..."

"Of course. Well, she is leaving, and I convinced your father to let you see her off. He didn't want to allow it. But I insisted." They sat in silence for a moment.

"Mother, are you crying?"

"I..I don't know, dear. I suppose I should never have let you get so attached to Avalon. Somehow it made being sequestered away in this house and this estate easier to bear. I don't know why. I knew that she would have to leave eventually."

"Do you know why?"

Her mother shook her head, "Not fully, but I have my suspicions. The priests are very secretive, and your father doesn't share much. I know that it is an honor and privilege to have Avalon in our lives. But now that time has come to an end."

The princess inched forward to her mother and laid her head on her shoulder. Her mother had always acted more like the Queen who happened to her mother, than the other way around. Her care, and this moment of affection, was unusual, seemed to come out of nowhere. But the princess welcomed it. So many things were changing, but for a moment she felt a sense of comfort and relief.

Her mother wiped her eyes dry with a handkerchief. "I've already laid out your things. You'll be wearing sturdy boots and your heavy winter cloak. It's cold this morning. And we're traveling to the coast, where it is even colder."

Once she was dressed, the princess went downstairs to the front of the house. Outside, a three carriages were ready and waiting for thier passengers. The horses' breath rolled in clouds in the cold air.

She saw that her father and the High Priest were sitting in the first carriage. The High Priest caught her eye and nodded at her, even as he wore a look of disapproval on his face.

She was motioned to the last carriage by one of the footmen. Her mother was sitting in there already, wrapped up in a fur lined cloak.

They waited until Avalon appeared walked through the front door. Somehow she seemed even more frail in the day light. She walked slowly, with two priests behind her. A footman helped her up into the middle carriage and the priests joined them.

They traveled most of the day to reach the coast. The princess hardly took in the farms and small villages they passed through. Finally, she could see a tower standing on the shoreline and assumed that was their destination.

The tower sat on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the sea. The tower keeper and a few sailers waited for them at the base of the tower then led them down the stop steps in the cliff face to the beach.

The beach was rocky and littered with green stones. Just as her mother had said, the wind blew in bursts and gusts, whipping her cloak and dress in hollowed out shapes against her body.

Once on the beach, they headed towards a dock that had been built out in to the water. The dock was old. The wood faded gray, with green coloring in places. A small sailboat was docked there waiting for them. There was another sailor on the boat, making preparations to leave.

The princess walked at the back of the party with her mother. The party stopped well before the dock. The priests and Avalon continued on to the dock with her father and the high priests. The princess started to join them, but her mother held her back, "You must stay here, darling." Her mother said softly, so softly that the princess almost didn't hear her over the wind and crashing waves.

The priests helped Avalon on to the boat. They seemed to be reciting something and making gestures as they sat on the boat before her. Finally, Avalon sat down, keeping her out of the princess's view entirely. The High Priest nodded to the two other priests, and they sat down as well.

Two of the sailors united the boat and pushed it into the tide, before jumping on themselves. The princess saw oars appear at the sides of the boat to take them further out, clear of the tide.

She stood on the shoreline, quiet, watching Avalon be taken away. It seemed more like going in to exile than some kind of retirement. But maybe that was exactly the point. Maybe Avalon was going in to exile.

The wind continued to howl and whip at her, chaffing her skin. She tried to pull her hood more tighly over her head, but it blew off again. She watched as the ship faded into the horizon, nothing more than a small being carried on the tide, with only one way to go, to take Avalon to her final resting place.

# Chapter 4: India #

The Queen walked the line of young woman standing before her. They seemed like children to her, even though there were maybe fifteen years or so separating her from the oldest of them. These young woman represented different parts of the kingdom, different stations. Some were bareboned and hungry looking. Some wore the bored expression of someone who hasn't known hardship and difficulty.

The Queen did not know what she was looking for, what quality was she meant to detect in one of these candidates. She also found herself trying to imagine what this ceremony must have been like in the past, when her father walked the same line. What had he seen in the canddiates he choose?

One of her advisers, who had also served her father later in his life, trailed behind the queen. The old man twittered with little sounds of approval or disapproval depending on the woman. The Queen felt a pang of despair that this process was pointless.

Nevertheless, the adviser leaned towards her and whispered, "Your majesty, have you come to a decisions?"

She had not come to a decision. Perhaps she didn't want to come to a decision because she knew very well what this decision meant for her, for the candidate. Nevertheless, it was her duty to make this decision. So much depended upon it, or so the many people whispering in her ear beforehand told her.

She ignored the adviser, swept around and walked the line again. She stopped in front of one of the candidates, one of the youngest, just as the young woman was trying to furtively wipe her nose. The Queen looked at her. The young woman looked down, probably as she had been instructed to do.

"What is your name?"

"India, your highness."

"That is a pretty name. Are you not well?"

"No...yes..your majesty. I don't know. The air here is much differnet than my home."

"Yes, I suppose it is."

"Would you like to be selected, child?"

The young woman, India, was silent. The woman behind her, a mother or grandmother, nudged the girl and hissed, "Answer the queen."

"Yes, your highness."

"India, look at me." She looked at the queen. "Tell me how you really feel."

"I'm terrified your highness."

"Of me?"

India looked around the lavish room they stood in. "Of everything...but I will do my duty, queen. I diligent and will get something done when I put my mind to it."

"Good. Thank you for your honesty." The queen turned to her advisors and attendants standing opposite the line of women. "Tell the priests, this is my candidate."

The Queen turned and left the room, her advisers and attendants falling in line behind her. The senior adviser, the one who had been following her closely and whispering in her ear, hastened to catch up with her. "Your majesty, your majesty," he called after her.

The Queen stopped, closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The adviser was a nuisance she had to tolerate, just one of many things she had to tolerate in her new role. Her ascendancy to the throne had not been easy, no less because of this adviser and his scheming. But she knew he was a necessary evil; he was very connected to many of the most powerful houses.

She wanted this decision, the choice of new person to the wear the robes, to keep the kingdom's stories and memories, to be her own. Obviously this was not to be. She had to suffer the opinions of the fools around her, the remnants of her father's court.

"Yes, what is it?" she replied. She turned to the adviser, "I have made my decision. I made it clear."

"Of course your majesty, very clear. But before we forward your candidate to the priests, might I suggest that we consider all points of view."

"What are these points of view? I was given a group of young women to chose from. I chose one. Is there something lacking in my discernemnt or discretion?"

"No, not lacking. I would never imply such a thing..." The adviser's paused. "I would suggest you consider how this choice might affect other aspects of life in the kingdom."

"Such as?"

"This is an important choice. The candidate will take on a very important place in your court, in the kingdom. Perhaps there is another candidate to consider, one who might represent the interests of the kingdom better."

As the spoke, the other advisers and attednants were crowded in the hallway behind them, maintaing a respectful distance, but clearly within earshot of this debate between the monarch and her adviser. She saw them loitering over his shoulder and did not want to continue playing out this scene with an audience.

The Queen waved forth one of her attendants. As the attendnant approached, the adviser seemed to grimace in frustration. "Yes, my lady?"

"Please draw a scalding hot bath. I am in need of a soak before I attend to more of the day's business. See to it that I am disturbed."

"Yes my lady." The attendant continued down the hall, then disappeared up a flight of steps to another wing of the Queen's house.

The queen turned to the adviser, "We will continue this conversation later, in my study. Behind closed doors."

The adviser bowed his head, "As you wish your highness."

The adviser motioned forward the coterie of adviser, his lackeys and cronies, and left the Queen with hers there in the hallway.

***

After her bath, the Queen stood wrapped tightly in a dressing gown at the window in her room. The window overlooked a bustling street in the town where she had moved her residence upon her coronation. She had inwardly proclaimed to herself, "I will not be a monarch in exile." which was another way of saying that she would not be like her father.

The captain of the Queen's Guard had cautioned her against this decision, at least asked her to take up residence in the fortified tower that had been part of the old walled city. "I will not be set in stone behind thick walls," she said, nearly stomping her feet in frustration. She had learned to quell these gestures and outbursts early on. She could always see the smirks that crossed faces around her when she acted out her frustration this way.

She was not a young woman when she was crowned, but still young enough to not be considered a suitable replacement for her father. She was, after all, the first female heir to the throne in many, many generations.

Instead, she chose to situate herself in the midst of the bustling modern part of the city, the part that had swallowed up and subsumed the old walled part. This sectino of the town, already bustling and vibrant, grew dramatically once word spread about the Queen's new house. Prominent families bought blocks of houses around her. It seemed at first that she was being walled in by these influence seekers and rivals. She grew to accept this, just as she accepted many other aspects of her new life, her new identity.

She still enjoyed being able to look out and see the bustle around her, feel connected to something like the life of this place, of the kingdom. Someone on the street must have noticed her standing there, though, and a crowd began to form in the street. She watched for a moment as the people waved, pointed, wisphered, snickered, and observed her. She basked in the attention momentarily then began to feel self conscious. She waved to the people, then withdrew from the window, just as the Guardsmen began to break up the crowd.

The bell at her dressing table summoned her maids, who dressed their queen for the evening. She had duties to perform in her study, before preparing for a state dinner hosting one of those prominent families that had encroached on this neighborhood.

Once in her study, it was only a matter of minutes before a knock at the door announced her adviser's arrival.

"Yes, enter," she called out, standing to wait for him. A guard opened the door and the adviser crept into the room.

The adviser sat opposite her, but was seized by a coughing fit before he could speak. The Queen waited patiently for this to pass.

"I assume that you want to continue our conversation from before," the Queen started.

"Yes, your majesty."

"And what is your concern. Please say it plainly so that I may understand. I do not like slinking around the matter."

"Of course. I am concerned that some in the kingdom may feel slighted by this decision, your majesty."

"And why is that?"

"This child you chose..."

"India."

"Yes, India. A pretty charming name, for a pretty and charming young lady, no doubt. But she does not come from a prominent family, does not come from a prominent place."

"Then why was she put before me as a candidate."

"Well, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there are considerations there as well. We don't want the lesser houses and lesser regions of the kingdom to feel slighted either."

"So you gather up their young people for this candidacy. Make them travel far and wide, only to be snubbed their Queen. Is that my understanding?"

The adviser smiled, as if trying to smile away the ire that had crept into her voice, "Your majesty is much too ungenerous. Trust me that there are considersations like this at every turn that we must consider. So many delicate threads that must be held in tension together to maintian the fabric of our kingdom."

"You mean my kingdom?"

"Yes, of course your majesty. I only meant..."

"I know what you meant. Your meaning is plain. You think me a fool. You think me as someone to play, to wrap up in your subtle games. Have you made some promise to someone that I am not aware of? Perhaps our guests tonight?"

The adviser shifted in his seat back and forth, seeming to feign being offended, "Your majesty I would never..."

"Please do not treat me like the child you knew when my father was kind. I am not a child. I am aware of how whispers travel through these walls."

As if deciding the shift tactics, the adviser stood and said boldly, "Very well then, yes. You should, no you must select a different candidate, one that will please the lord you are hosting tonight. He is expecting a different outcome and to chose otherwise would greatly displease him."

The queen stood as well. She had not grown into a tall woman, but she held herself upright and said firmly, "At least we understand one another, then. I will consider your words and make my decision. You will be informed once I do. Please see yourself out now."

The adviser bowed and left the room, leaving the queen to pace furiously around the room.

This decision, a decision she didn't even want to make, was becoming burden to her. Perhaps she should give the adviser his victory, let him gloat to his coterie that he had won over the Queen, let the word of his influence spread wide and far. Perhaps it would embolden him to be less furtive about his schemes.

Besides, releasing the child from this burden, would that be such a terrible thing? The Queen knew the fate that was in store for this young woman, at least knew the broad outlines. She knew what had happened to her precious Avalon and still carried the grief from that moment in her life with her, even into her adulthood.

"Let them condemn their precious candidate to this fate," the Queen said out loud to herself, a childhood habit she found herself indulging more and more in her lonely life as a monarch.

***

Dinner that night began with a breach of protocol, but first flattery. "Your majesty, you look stunning tonight," the lord said upon seeing her in the receiving line.

"Thank you lord, I trust you were amenable to our negotions in advance of tonight's occassions."

"Mmm, yes, very amenable. I always find a way to make myself amenable." The lord said, with a large number of guests following behind him.

The lord she was hosting was known to have a large entourage of retainers that accompanied him in his social outings. This lord had been warned by her house managers that the Queen would not entertain this large number of guests. In the weeks before the dinner, there had been ongoing negotiations about the number of said guests. Whatever number they had arrived upon, the lord brought more. Her staff had to quickly reset the dinner service for more guests.

The dinner service met her guests approval. Many were surprised and delighted by the unusual dishes they sampled. Each one coming to highly regard the Queen's taste, assured to walk away with the opinion that their yougn Queen was entirely modern and to be respected. Or at least that was the intended effect. Her kitchen staff excelled at her jobs. She had taken care, before she resented the advice hurled at her by her advisors, to retain chefs from different parts of the kingdom, who could "meld the flavors of the land together," as one put it. Her guests tonight, though fashionable and notorious across the kingdom, were, ultimately quite parochial.

She came to this realization herself not long into dinner once she grew bored of the conversation around her. Her few attempts to engage the guests around her in various issues occuring around the kingdom, fell flat. They were able to talk about art up until a point, a topic that the Queen had lately become more interested in, but again found that the knowledge of her guests was ultimatley shallow and, frequently, devolved into gossip. Apparently, the love lives of artists was more interesting than their work.

For her part, the Queen cared little for the intricate lines that crisscrossed and interconnected these people's social lives. Even though her lack of care or concern made her feel somewhat disconnected from these people, she also felt a sense of relief that she did not to muster up any sincere feeling on the topic.

The longer these conversations went on, the more she retreated into her self, explored her own thoughts and observations. On this particular night, this almost reached the point where she could feel that she was observing herself as if she was separate from herself. She could see a Queen sitting in a crowded room of people dressed in their finery, talking, flirting, eating, drinking. And yet her consciousness was nowhere to be found in the scene. It was somewhere else entirely.

For the moment, it settled into scenes from her youth when she might have imagined situations like this. Scenes that ranged from girlish parties she might have thrown for her dolls, having loquacious grown up conversations, or at least what a child imagines grown up conversations to be like, to occassions where she was finally dismissed from the drawing room after a long night so that the adults could continue their conversations or card games.

Of course, situated somewhere in these scenes, was a ghostly faint figure of Avalon, who seemed to float across her memories of her youth like a mist. Sometimes she could scarely remember what Avalon looked like, yet could sense her presence in her memories.

After dinner, the party installed itself in the Queen's parlor, a large space that she had filled with art and musical instruments. One of the guests began strumming on a rare stringed instrument that had been given to her early on in her rule and travelled about the kingdom more. Singing soon followed. Drinks were flowing and the Queen's staff rushed to meet the demands of this voracious host the lord had let into her house.

Amidst all of the noise, she slipped out of the room and paced the main hall. To her surpise, the lord appeared beside her, he turned on his heel, seeming to scan his surroundings, really her surroundings.

"I must say, I approve. Very modern tastes, your majesty," the lord replied.

She looked at him, but said nothing. She had learned, among other lessons, that a monarch need not always reply when spoken to. This suited her disposition well, and had the added benefits of keeping her out of trouble.

"And dinner was equisite. Even I was surprised by a few of the dishes, and I am considered to be very well travel."

Again she said nothing.

"Please give my compliments to the chef and your staff. They have outdone themselves."

"Of course, I would expect nothing less of them. I will be sure that they are made aware of the compliemtn though."

"Thank you your majesty."

She started to return to the parlor, referring to abide in the din in that room than be subjected to the lord's overbearing charms.

"Ah your majesty, since we have this private moment together, I wondered if we might discuss a matter of some importance to me."

"As you wish."

"Excellent, but may I suggest that we take a seat first. I do not discussing state business while standing in such a transitory location. I find that the urge to pace or walk does not lend itself to deep, reflective conversation."

They sat in a nearby alcove on a padded bench. The queen arranged herself on the bench first, leaving as little room as she could for the lord, without being too obvious about the fact.

The lord gingerly sat on the bench's edge, seeming to not give much thought to the arrangement, or suppressing any indication that he did.

"What did you wish to discuss, now that we are sitting in a more amenable spot?" the Queen asked.

"I wished to speak about the selection of the candidate. I have been led to understand that there were some kinks in the process to work out, that perhaps the final decision had not been made. I hoped that you might avail yourself of my council to...expedite the process."

The queen studied the lord momentarily. He wasn't much older than herself, perhaps even younger. His intensity gave him a boyish quality. But there was a hunger and desire for power that undercut the appearance of youthful exuberance. He was, as he fashioned himself, fashionable, perhaps even handsome. He was a notorious bachelor, though it was rumored that he had walked away from at least one engagement. Even she knew that much from dipping her toe in the world of rumor and gossip.

"While I appreciate the guesture and offer, I will not require your assistance in the matter," she finally replied. She coudl see the lord's anger rising, his face growing stern and rigid. He was preparing to do battle with her. Her. His queen. He was going to will his choice to be her choice. It was bold and impertient. She was glad that she had already resolved to undermine this and not provide him the satisfcation of cajoling her to do his bidding. "I completely agree that the candidate your put forward should be the one advanced to the priest."

The lord looked disarmed by this unexpected reply. Perhaps he even looked disappointed. She was sure that forcing her to change her mind would have made an excellent story to share later.

***

Despite breaking many of the protocols around attending a function at the Queen's house, the guests did observe a well established rule that when the monarch announces they are retiring for the night, the party is over. As soon as she stood and made this pronouncement, the guests began bowing, making their compliments, and leaving.

When she finally made it back to her chambers, she sat relieved that the night was over, at least that part of it. She knew she had one burdensome task left before the day was truly over. She must deliver the news to the candidate she had chosen, the girl named India, that she would not be the candidate after all.

She thought about how she would broach this topic with this young woman, assuming that she would find the Queen's news confusing, perahsp even upsetting. But the Queen felt she should not delay, felt she owned the terrified, honest girl the relief she would gain from knwoing the truth.

Once she was changed, she instructed her maid to have the house manger and house mistress come to her room. When the older man and woman appeared finally, they looked upon her as if she stood in the middle of her room naked, though she was only in her night clothes. The Queen chose to ignore this and said to them, "I wish to visit one of the candidates from the selection today. Please take me there."

They both replied, "Yes your majesty" and showed her the way.

The house she occupied was very large, not as large as the house she grew up in, but large nevertheless. It wrapped around a courtyard, as well, and bridge crossed a street to connect a smaller house to it as well. Many of the house servants and staff lived in this other section. This was also where they had lodged the candidates for the few nights they needed to be available for the ceremony.

The servants quarters was quiet, but she could hear many of the servants who probably were light sleepers after so many years of service, stirring at the sound of the padding feet down the hall.

A few doors opened, followed by gasps and "Pardon me, your majesty." Some of the servants had never seen their queen up close before, much less dressed in such a casual way.

As she passed, the queen gave these shocked onlookers a downward handgesture as if to say, "carry on and don't make a fuss."

They rounded a corner, went up two flights of stairs, until they were at the top floor of the wing. The ceilings were low and the air was stuffy up here, despite one of the small round windows at the end of hall being opened to the cool night air.

They walked mid way down the hall and stopped at the door. the house manager said, "The young lady is quartered in here with her grandmother. They're probably both asleep by now, though earlier there was quiet a bit of commotion up here."

The housemistress gave the man a dispapproving look, "We had a number of upset young ladies, that is all your majesty. There was some consoling, and celebrating as well."

"That is fine," the queen replied. "Please knock and announce my presence."

The house manager did as instructed. The house mistress walked through the open door into the room and the sleepy voices that met them. The queen could hear a match strick and lantern lit. The housemistress returned to the door, "They're ready for you now, my lady."

The Queen stepped into the small room -- two simple beds pushed against either wall. A washing table between the two beds. Two traveling chests were stacked on top of each other to her right.

Much like the hallway, they had the two small window open. The coarse, simple curtains were pulled back, but the night breeze tossed them about.

The grandmother was still asleep, her back turned to the room. The young woman, India, stood in front of her bed.

The Queen tried to smile at her, to portray herself as a benificient presence, though she could tell that India was terrified. "There's no reason to be afraid, I just wanted to deliver a message to you in person."

"Yes, your majesty."

"Perhaps we should step in the hall and not wake your grandmother."

"She will not wake, she's a sound slepper. And...she's not my grandmother. Not really."

"What do you mean?"

"I was adopted. She raised me, trained me. For this moment. I've dreamed of nothing else  for many years."

The Queen was not expecting this turn, "I see. Will you sit down? I would like to sit next to you."

India tentatively stepped back to sit and the Queen approached the bed.

The house mistress tried to intervene, "We can bring your majesty chairs, if you'd be more comfortable."

"No, this is fine, thank you."

The bed sagged as she sat down, but she didn't let this distract her from her purpose.

"I wanted to tell you in person that something has changed."

"Changed, your majesty?"

"Yes, I will not be recommending you as the candidate to the priests?"

"Is it something I've done? I promise I can do better whatever it is."

The Queen reached out and took the young woman's trembling hand in her own. Her hands were soft, much like hers at this age. She's been kept from labor and work, the Queen realied. She's been held back from hardship for this moment. Again, this didn't make her task any easier.

"No, it is not because of you."  The queen paused. "Can I tell you a secret?"

"Me? Of course your highness."

"Being Queen doesn't mean you get to make all of the decision. This fact came as a great shock to me at first. I should say that I make many decisions, but some are to satisfy the wishes of others. A Queen's duty is to express the wishes and will of her people, not just her own."

"I don't understand."

"I mean to say that if I were able to, I would have recommended you. I can see that you would be a very capable candidate to wear the robe, to serve my kingdom. But I have other forces to weigh, other people to satisfy. Powerful people. So, I must chose a different candidate."

The woman looked down at her hand in the Queens hand and removed it, holding it in her lap. "I see. Is that all, your majesty."

The Queen did not mean for this conversation to go this way, she had hoped that this terried young woman would breath a sigh of relief, maybe give her an improper hug in her joy. Instead she had derailed this person from her path

She stood up, deciding it was best to leave India with her misery for now. Perhaps she could find some way to make it up to her. "No, that is all. I am very sorry for this. Thank you and good night."

The next morning, the Queen decided to take her breakfast in the solarium. Several birds had taken up residence among the lush foliage in there and she came to find their chattering comforting.

She had finished breakfast and was closing her eyes, listening to the birds, when she heard footsteps and the clank of armor and swords. She opened her eyes to see the captain of the guard, accompained by one of his guardsmen, along with the house mistress.

"Captain? This is an unexpected visit. What is it?"

They all look grief stiken, even the stoic Captain, who had lived to see many horrible things.

"I am afraid that I must deliver bad news, your majesty."

"Yes, tell me. Don't be evasive."

"There has been a terrible tragedy in the house. The young woman you met with last night, India, my lady."

"What about her?"

"She was found dead this morning."

"Dead, how? Have we tightened security?"

"This was no murder, your majesty. The young lady hung herself by her bedsheets from the rafters in her room."

The Queen closed her eyes. The birds seemed to scream now around her. Her head pounded. "What of the lady who was with her, her grandmother?"

"She has disappeared, my lady. No one saw her leave the grounds."

"Do my advisers know?"

"I cannot say for sure, but I fear that word may spread quickly."

"Be sure that it doesnt. By any means necessary. Do yo understand?"

"Yes my lady."

The housemistress stepped forward, "My lady."

"Yes?"

"I don't mean to be indelicate, but what are we to do with the body?"

"Make arrangements for the body to be cremated and bring the ashes to me. In something discrete, not ostentatious. Do you understand?"

"Yes my lady."

# Chapter 5: While My Heart Is Still Beating #

The Queen learned from several weeks later that the Priests approved the her candidate, her final candidate. Her senior advisor was delicate to the point of being ostentatious in the care he was taking to avoid mentioning the first candidate.

The whispers died down within a few days, in part because the Queen had a housemaid who had been assigned to look after the candidates' quarters was dismissed from "idle talk and gossip." After that, the house grew queit on the subject of a woman that some may, or may not, have remembered was India.

The news that the priests selected her candidate came with more news from the priest, and thus from her senior adviser, who seemed very well acquainted with the priests' ways.

"Under normal circumstances, the monarch would host the candidate's robing ceremony. The priests have made an appeal your majesty in light of the circumstances."

"What circumstances are those?" the Queen asked, not trying to be arch with her question.

"Your majesty, trust me when I saw that they are not referring to *those* circumstances. I mean, rather, that the priests are planning to have...well...a coronation of their own, as if turns out."

"I was not aware that the priests bore titles and wore crowns," the Queen replied.

"I merely meant it as a turn of phrase, your majesty. I mean to say that a new High Priest has been selected as well. You have been invited as a distinguished guests to the new High Priest's ordination ceremony as well. Becuase of this, it was proposed, I should say that I proposed that we combine the celebrations into one."

"Yes, go on."

"It would be an excellent opportunity for your majesty to venture out into the kingdom again."

"My father rarely took such trips."

"Yes, that is true, but, and I mean no disrespect, that things are very different now compared to then."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning several things. The people are very much interested in their Queen. Your appearance would brighen hears and ease minds. As you know, your majesty, there a spirit of unease and discontent growing among the people."

"I have read the reports, but you have said previously these were no cause for concern, just idle individuals indulging in fantastical expressions of violence."

"That may have been true now, but I am beginning to take a different view of teh matter, a much darker view."

"Indeed, it seems so. And you belive that I should venture out in this much darker version of the world around us. Do I understand this correctly?"

"We would need to consult with your guard and ensure your majesty would be well protected. But thing of the impact it would have, seeing the monarch's face throughout the land, on on such an auspicious occasion, two auspicious occasions no less."

The advisor was very convinced by the sound logic of his own reasoning. He seemed ready to take her place in the wagon train and wave to the noble peasants and workers, his subjects, across the kingdom.

She begrudgingly admitted to herself, however, that his plan was a sound one. It was had been several years since her first royal tour. Traveling again would be pleasant. In fact, her heart stirred as she thought about leaving the confines of her house and the city for a while. The episode with India still weighed heavily on her mind. She had misread the situation so completely, which turned out to be a fatal error.

She rang a bell, causing one of the guards to open the door and a footman enter the room and bow. "Please summon the captain of the guards. I must consult with him on an urgent matter."

When the door closed, the advisor turned to her, "A delightful turn of events, your majesty."

The captain of the guard, however, had a different take on the proposal. He swept his flat hand across his body, as if sweeping away the suggestion, cleaving it from its spot so it would topple over, "Out of the question," he replied to the advisor, once the advisor finished introducing his various provisions and considerations. The captain turned to the queen, "Your majesty, even at the best of times, the roads leading to the priests' citadel can be dangerous. They offer very little cover, terribly visibility. They wind through small hamlets that have a long history of causing the monarch trouble."

"What kind of trouble?"

"Petty thefts, horse stealing, assassination attempts, secession, to name a few. As I am sure you aware, I feel that a new wave of discontent will swell up in the region and overtake us."

"Would this only take one or two weeks to happen? We must depart within a week."

The advisor remained silent. The captain took a deep breath, "Your word is our law, your highness. We are the Queen's Guard, and we are bound to protect you with our lives. As guardsmen, we take this calling seriously and will gladly lay down our lives for you, but I cannot, in good faith, willingly put you in a situation where you might be required to lay down your own as well."

"Captain, I understand that you must protect your men's lives, and mine as well, but you must find a way to make this journey work."

"Yes your majesty."

***

Within a week, the Queen found herself riding in a large caravan of horses, carts, soldiers, and servants. She had never seen such an assemblage before, outside of a war party. In fact, it almost seemed like she was mounting a small expedition to go topple the priests, rather than be their esteemed guest.

Once they left the city behind, they traveled for several days through farms and countryside. At first she enjoyed the spare, empty land they traveled through. She felt hungry for the scenery, for the stimulation that seeing new things fed to her.

She didn't sleep well at first, partly due to the continual sounds the guards made clanking around their nightly encampments. Once she could tune out their sounds though, the night was so quiet, a quiet she wasn't used to anymore.

She supposed that this must have been what nights sounded like when she was growing up, isolated on her father's large estate. They were in a remote part of the kingdom. She knew that, but didn't recall it being so lifeless and quiet.

After several nights, though, she grew used to the calm and quiet, which made being woken up in the midle of the night on their fourth night, that much more startling.

She must have been awoken by the shouting, or maybe it was the long groaning and moaning that seemed to come from the center of camp. Whatever the cause, the two guards who were stationed outside her door rushed in, swords drawn, and positioned themselves near her.

The Queen sat up and demanded, "What is going on out there?"

One of the guards replied, not ever looking at her, "We do not know your majesty. There seems to be a skirmish of some kind."

"What is that awful wailing?"

The other guard answered, "It seems that someone is injured."

"One of our own? One of the guard?"

The same guard replied, "That is unlikely, your majesty. We are trained to suffer in silence in the even that we are wounded."

The other guard cut in, "Please your majesty, dress yourself quickly and be prepared to move in the event that we must leave."

Another figure rushed into the tent. The two guards struck defensive poses, but a firm voice instructed, "Stand down, men. The threat is clear, for now."

"Captain, please tell me that everything is alright out there."

"I apologize your majesty, our camp was overrun by a crowd of travelers. There were words exchanged, and one of them injured, after a fight with one of the guards."

"Who are these people? Where are they going?"

"I do not know the answers to that." The Queen stood up and threw her traveling cloak over her nightgown. "Where are you going, your majesty?"

"I am going to find out the answers and to see what state this injured individual is in at the moment."

The din outside was even worse than it had been in the tent. She crossed through the center of the encampment, past a watch fire they guard tended through the night, and saw her guards, keeping a large crowd of people back with their swords.

She looked around and saw a man laying on the ground, clutching at a spot on his tunic that was blooming into a large read pool of blood, much too large for this hand to cover. She turned to one of the guards that accompanied her, "You, fetch the doctor immediately."

The guard rushed to one of the nearby tents to rouse the doctor who the Captain had insisted travel with them. Now the Queen was thankful that she had listened to the captain and heeded what seemed, at the time, to be overly cautious advice.

The doctor stumbled from his tent and towards the patient and starting administering aid to the injured man. Another man stepped forward from the crowd towards the Queen. Her guards stepped between them and began pushing the man back. The man shouted in reply, "Please, I must speak with the Queen. Please hear our appeal."

"Let him pass and let him speak," the Queen replied. As the man approached him, she could already tell the desperate, miserable condition that he was in. She scanned the group's faces too, firelight catching their eyes, bring them to life despite their tired, worn look.

The guards stopped the man before he was within arms reach of the Queen. He didn't bow or bend his knee but looked her in the eyes and started his appeal, "Please your majesty, we ask for your aid and protection."

"First help me understand what is happeneing and then we will discuss your appeal."

As if in response, the man help up his hands in the firelight. She could see that they were rough and calloused. "We are workers, your majesty. Several families of workers. We have been traveling for many years now from place to place. We are masons and carpenters." The man paused, "My father's father worked on your father's estate, helped to build the great house. May he rest in peace."

"For years we have been able to move around the kingdom undisturbed, work was plentiful. But now..."

"Go on, do not hestitate to speak the truth."

"Now I fear times are much worse. We are met with suspicion. Riders and soliders harrass us and prevent us from camping outside their towns. We haven't been able to work for over a month. We have been wandering. We have no food, our tents were seized by robbers."

The captain stepped forward when the man stopped speaking, "And what would you have the Queen do? Lend aid to any beggar that crosses her path?"

The man looked back and forth between them, "Aid? Comfort? I mean no disrespect, but who else are we to look to for these things? We feel we are being led along a path we don't know and don't understand. Is there to be no comfort for us?"

The Queen replied, "You will have what food and medicine we can spare. We are traveling too and only have enough provisions for our journey. I wish we could do more, but that is all I can offer."

The man bowed, "We will gratefully take what your majesty has offered."

"And I ensure that your young man is supplied with medicine to make his well again." She turned to the Captain and consulted with him. The captain reluctantly agreed before she turned back to say, "And I will have one of my guardsmen accompany you to the next town. In the morning, I will give you a letter of protectino with my seal on it granting you safe passage."

"Again, we thank you. Our people will never forget your majesty's kindness."

She turned back to her tent to catch what little sleep there was left to be had. She sat with the feeling that these gestures seemed futile in light of the conditions these people were facing. Another thought picked and poked at her as she tried to sleep. How could things be so bad in the kingdom and she was completely unaware of it? Why had she not heard of the plight of these people before?

As she turned over this question, she realized that there was no one wearing the cloak, no one to watch over the kingdom on her behalf. These thoughts put into focus for her the importance of the ceremony with the priests and putting the ugly affairs of the last few days behind her.

***

After several more days of traveling, the party reached the largest river that separated the kingdom in two. The river wasn't particularly wide, but it was deceptively deep, with dangerous undercurrings lurking beneath the surface Crossing the river proved to be even more difficult because the bridge had been badly damaged during a storm. The Queen was surpised to learn that the storm had happeend several months back, and yet it had not been repaired, or rather repairs were ongoing.

Instead, the party had to be ferried across the river. The crossing point was half a day's journey and would take them further away from their destination. The foreman overseeing the bridge repairs wouldn't budge and let them try to cross the bridge, so they were forced to take the ferries.

The ferry was crude. Nothing more than a flat platform with a large rope spanning the river.  Three or four ferry operators would pull the ferry across using the Sitting and waiting for each cart and carriage to be taken across,  the Queen wondered if it was significant that on one side of that river was the Queen's palace, and on the other the priests' citadel.

Surely this separation affected the way the priests conducted their affairs and thought about their relationship with the monarch. She wondered if the priests would treat her any differently when she was a guest in their citadel, their palace.

"Ma'am, are you okay?" her attendant asked her. The Queen would often get so lost in thought that she would forget that there was a young woman travelling with her who was supposed to attent to her needs and keep her company. The Queen felt bad for the woman, momentarily. She probably had expectations about how exciting it would be to ride with the Queen, getting an intimate view of the court's inner workings. Instead she was riding with a woman who kept starting out of her carriage window, contemplating the meaning of rivers.

When it was their turn to cross, the queen was surprised by how much the carriage moved on the ferry's flat platform. From a distance the whole affair had seemed very simple and straightforward. Now she regretted being stuck inside the carriage. 

She leaned forward to the attendant and said, "Ask the driver if I may stand outside. I am feeling unwell being cooped up in here."

"Yes, ma'am."

She could hear the carraige driver talking it over with the ferrymen, who agreed it was okay. The carriage door opened and the driver helped the queen down. "Just stand near the carriage if you don't mind your majesty. It's been tied down quite well and will give you something to hold on to if you require it."

"Thank you," the Queen replied. She felt like she could tolerate river's rocking motion better now that she was standing on her own feet. One of the ferryman drew a whistle out from under his rough spun shirt and give a shrill call with it. The other ferrymen took up the rope and began pulling the ferry across. 

It took another hour or so for the remainder of her party to cross. Once they were all assembled on the priests's side of the river, the party continued its journey.

***

By the middle of the next day, the attendant awoke the Queen from a light nap, "Your majesty, I can see it."

It took a moment for the Queen to slip back into the present moment, "What's that?"

"The citadel your majesty. I could see the tops of its spires." The Queen looked out both windows but could not make out what the attendant was seeing. 

They rounded a corner, and the attendant gasped, "It's so grand, I had no idea!"

The Queen positioned herself on the same side of the carriage as the attendant. Looking out the window to judge for herself, she had to agree. The citadel, indeed, was grand.

She felt a feeling of irksome irritation pass through her. Her city-based home was modest by comparison. Much more modern, of course, but modest. Her father's estate had not seemed as grandiose as the priests's citadel.

Even from this distance she could being to make out the citadel was really a collection of several buildings, surrounded by a fortified wall, in the old style, and focused around a central hall with a tall center spire.

As they drew closer, she could feel the carriage slant back as they made their way up the long causeway that led to the citadel's gate. She observed that the fortified walls, though seemingly old, were still imposing. They gave the citadel the appearance of a structure built for war, for calamity, and not for spiritual reflection.

As they wound through the maze of streets, the Queen realized that the citadel was really a small city unto itself. The streets were dotted with merchants and stalls. Butchers, knife sharpeners, trash collectors. And squalor. The Queen was surpised by how dirty everythign and everyone inside the walls were. 

It wasn't until they passed another interior fortified wall that they entered a groomed garden cultivated trees and trimmed rows of shrubbery. The Queen realized that this must be due to the former High Priest who, so many years ago, had explained that he took an abiding interest in plants and cultivation.

A contingent of priests and servants greeted the Queen's party outside the imposing steps that led to the great, central hall. The leader of the priest's contingent stepped forward to greet the Queen, "Your majesty, welcome to the citadel. We are most honored to welcome you and have you as our guest."

"Thank you."

"If you will accompany me, I will escort you to your quarters."

They started to make their way up the long flight of stone stairs. The stairs were a series of stairs connected by landings. The landings spanned out and seemed to lead off in different directions, suggesting that this great hall had many layers and levers to it.

The priest accompanying her was silent while they walked, until they reached the third of four landings. She stopped and turned to the queen, "We often encourage guests to pause here. You will find this spot offers an excellent vantage point of the citadel and the land around it. The queen did as she was instructed and took in the scenery. 

The landscape wasn't what she was used to. Here the land was harsher, more rugged and mountainous. As she scanned the view and fell on the mountains that began to rise behind the citadel and disappear in the distance, she thought of the High Priest again and turned to her host, "I am surprised that the duty of greeting the soverign doesn't fall to the High Priest. Where might he be?"

"As you majesty knows we are in the midst of appointing a new High Priest."

"Then what of the current one?"

"I am afraid to say that there is no current one. The previous one...your current one if you take my meaning...passed several months back."

The queen tried to muster her best sympathetic look, "I am truly sorry to hear that. The High Priest was a great man, by all accounts."

"Indeed, your highness."

"But why such a gap?"

"Unfortunately, my vows do not allow me to comment on that. As I'm sure you can appreciate, I am duty bound to keep my order's secrets. That is one of our most deeply held secrets."

"I see, but I will be afforded a chance to meet the new High Pirest soon enough."

"Very soon, your majesty. In the meantime, I do not want to keep you from your quarters much longer. I'm sure you've had a long and tiring journey."

The Queen merely replied, "Indeed," and began to follow the priest again.

Her quarters were satisfactory, though she could tell by the look on her attendant's face that the attendant felt the rooms were not fitting for a queen. The walls were rough hewn stone. A fire burned in the large soot covered fireplace. Nothing was lavish. There were few decorations, little ornamentation. 

Once the Queen convinced her attendant that she didn't need anything, she was relieved to have a few moments of quiet to herself. She sat in a high backed arm chair by the fire and let her head fall into her propped up hand. 

As she dozed, she remembered through the scrambled haze of her sleep, the last time she had seen the High Priest. It wasn't during one of the rituals, like the time she originally met him. There had been several more rituals that she witnessed from afar after that one. She never took much interest in them after Avalon left, feeling wounded, if not betrayed, by the whole affair.

Instead, she could see herself sitting at her father's bedside. Her father had grown weak, shockingly weak in what seemed like the course of mere days. Doctors from across the kingdom were summoned to examine the king and weigh in on the king's condition.

In a fit of sorrow, her mother had even used her influence to have doctors of less savory reptuations visit, doctors who were just a likely to peddle nostrums in darkly colored vials, as provide legitimate medical device. But no amount of bleedings, leeches, or distilled venom from some rare serpent, seemed to help her father. 

But she remembered this particular moment so clearly because it was the last time she saw the High Priest. He had been summoned too. When he entered the room, she could hardly make eye contact with him. In his lofty and diginfied state, he hardly seemed to mind that he made this young princess uncomfortable. 

He did, however, come to stand by her and put his hand on her shoulder. The hand was meant to channel his will, much like before, but in a softer way than the rough grip he had used previously. Without looking at her, he said, "Princess, I must ask you to leave me. There are matters which I must discuss with the king now that I am here."

For some reason, she had started to tear up and weepily stood up to leave the room. The servants and guards had been dismissed too, which spoke to the High Priest's power and influence even over this household that was not his own. With no one around, the princess stopped at the door. It was a heavy door, but she knew from experience that she would still be able to hear through, especially with in the quiet that surrounded her.

"Your majesty," the High Priest began, "I am very disappointed to find you in this state. This is not how things were supposed to be." The High Priest must have been pacing around the bed, because suddenly she couldn't hear his voice as clearly.

Then she found it again, "The work is not done. I am afraid to say what will happen if the work is not completed. Look at me you highness." The pricess could hear some rustling, "The work must be completed. I have tried to warn you in the past about your daughter. You wouldn't hear me then, but you have no choice but to hear me now."

"She threatens everything we've worked for, everything your anestors worked to accoplish. No, not just accomplish, solidify. And that girl will not be able to see the work through. She is too rash and stoo sentimental."

She heard more muffled talking then, "Do not look away, do not turn away from what I am saying. You know it is true. You must be strong. I demand that you be strong and see things through."

The room fell silent and then she heared the High Priest's footsteps grow louder as he approached the door. She scrambled down the hall to find a hiding spot so she didn't get caught.

***

The Queen woke up to knocking at the door. She stirred but didn't sit right up, letting a wave of despair or sadness turn over her. Her attendant came in to inform her that they would dining privately tonight seeing as all of the priests and their servants were preparing for the festivities the next day.

This arrangements worked very well for the Queen as she was not in the mood or state of mind to sit through a formal dinner. In fact she turned to her attendant and said, "I would like to take a simple meal here in my chambers, instead."

"Yes your majesty. I will inform the staff, though they are not the easiest to communicate with."

Within the hour, two of the kitchen staff brough in two trays for her meal, including a salad of mushrooms that grew around the citadel, a plate of fruits and nuts, water and wine, and several types of soup. "Thank you. Yes, please leave it there. Thank you so much. Thank you," was all she could say to expediate the servants's departure from her room.

She are quickly and then said to her attendant, "I wish to take a walk, but I don't want to be suffocated by a guard and other staff."

Your majesy, is this a wise decision?" her attendant replied. I didn't come away with a favorable impression of the citadel."

"Your concenr is noted. I agree with you that much of the town that has grown up and round theis fortified seems to have fallen into neglect and disrepair.  But inside these walls seems very safe. I promise not to wander far. I am very tired after all."

The queen finally convinced her retinue to let her walk outside. When she reached the outside, she decided to explore the step terraces more. Walking down the stairs, she realized, even in the early nightime dark that the terraces had also been planted with bushes and trees and flowers. 

She found herself feeling refreshed by the cool night air, and enjoying walking in the early evening moonllight. The air was fragrant with flowers and fruit trees. The din from the city had queited down too. She would still hear a faint rumble of life in the distance, but she felt that she could be with her thoughts here for some time and feel quite content.

As she strolled, she did not come across many priests out walking. She occoassionaly would see small groups of priests or servants scurrying this way and that, probably trying to accomplish some task that needed doing before tomorrow.

She didn't see anyone, until she was a figure sitting on a bench. His head was closely shaved, but his hood pulled back. He was flipping through and reading a book he held in his left hand.

The Queen drew closer to him and said in the midst of her surprise, "Leif? Is that you?"

The figure on the bench looked up and her. Only this wasn't the boy she had met in the middle of a forest so long ago looking back at her. She could hardly see the smiling, energetic boy from that past. Instead a serious young man looked back at her, wrapped up in whatever he was contemplating in the book he held.

He look at her for a moment as if he could not see her. Then everything seemed to click into place. He stood up, deliberately, and said, "Your majesty. I had heared that you arrived safely early today. We were all relieved to hear the good news."

The Queen replied, "My goodness, Leif. You are a man, now. You are so grown up."

The man smield back at her, "And you are a woman now, and Queen too."

"Yes, she replied, but only for a few years now."

"Indeed."

"You are still a priest..." she said.

"You seemed surprised."

"I often wondered, after the last time I saw you..."

"Please, your majesty, I would prefer that we not talk about those events in great detail. Even now, I find those memories to be very distressing."

"Of course, we should focus on the present. Or better yet the future."

He smiled again, "Yes, I like that idea very much. Do you care to sit? I am afraid that I must finish this reading, but I would still very much appreciate the company."

She felt very rigid and formal, which contradicted the feelings she still associated with this boy after so many years. He seemed very changed now, serious and reflective. He was immersed in whatever he was reading. She tried to furtively glance at the text but it was written in a language she did not recognize. She sat next to him in silence, listening to night time sounds, feeling peaceful for the first time in a while. 

He closed the book and it disappeared into the pocket of his long robes. He turned to her and asked, "How do you find the citadel?"

"It is not what I was expecting."

"In what way?"

She wondered, before she replied, how much she should weigh her words. "It is larger, more grand in scale than I imagined."

"You assumed that the priesthood would live in more modest surroundings."

"Perhaps. I assumed austere, and there is something austere about the place, at least what I've seen. But there is...ambition in what I see too?"

His face turned into an odd expression. She wasn't sure if it was curiosity or offense, "Hmm, ambition. Interesting. Ambition to what end?"

"I cannot say, only being a visitor for a few hours."

"So you think the priesthood should not be ambitious. Certainly the monarchy is ambitous, is it not?"

"Explain your meaning, I do not follow."

"No I don't suppose you would." he replied, almost muttering, but she could make out the words. "Only in the last few years, the kingdom has expanded, seized new territory, has it not?"

"We've come to understandings with some of the outlying houses yes. In fact this is something I'm rather proud of. My father could never convince the lords of these houses to join the kingdom."

"Or didn't want to..." he replied.

"Perhaps. But I feel you are trying to imply or suggest something, but aren't speaking plainly."

"Me? No, your highness, I am merely engaging in conversation with an old friend, who happens to be the most powerful individual in the kingdom."

"The former High Priest may have begged to differ."

"Perhaps. And perhaps the new one will as well."

This last comment stoked her curiousity and interest. She leaned in to him. "Do you know who will be chosen as the next High Priest? This is news I should very much like to know."

"Yes, many would. And only a few know."

She looked at him shrewdly, "So maybe you do you. But aren't at libery to say."

"We are..."

She stepped in, "Bound by strict codes. Yes, I have heard of nothing but your codes since we arrived."

"The codes are important. There wouldn't be a priesthood without the codes. They make us who we are."

"And what are you, exactly?"

"Protectors," was his simple reply.

"And what does that make the make the monarch?"

"That remains to be seen."

The Queen paused, left silent by this remark. She was not sure what the make of what he had just said. She didn't have long to dwell on it because he abruptly stopp up and said, "I am glad we had this moment to speak. But I'm afraid that I must retire for the night. Tomorrow will be a very momentous day. Good night, your majesty."

"Yes, good night to you too."

# Chapter 6: The Main Thing #

The Queen learned in the morning that a very strict schedule had been established for the day's events and would be adhered to stricly. It had been decided in advance that the ceremony appointing the new High Priest would take place first. After a short break, the robing ceremony would take place.

The priest who had met her outside the citadel and, obviously, had been appointed to be her handler, ran through the schedule in her room. At the end, he paused and asked, "Would your majesty like to visit with the candidate?"

"The new High Priest?"

"No, your majesty, I mean your candidate to be the new observer."

"She's here?"

"Yes, your majesty. She has been here for several days. She arrived with Lord Burrington."

"I see. Yes, of course. I'm sure there are many preparations to make on such a momentous occassion," she commented.

"Naturally, your majesty."

She did think to herself that many of these preparations did not seem to require her presence or particiaption. She knew that the candidate was a favorite of Lord Burrington's, but why had he personally escorted her to the citadel. 

She decided it was worth her time to check in on the young woman, at least to guage what having her in her court on a day to day basis would be like. With everything that had happened following her decision to accept the lord's candidate, she had not been able to visit with the candidate at all. Everyone had been whisked away from palace as a safety measure.

"Your majesty?" the priest interjected, interrupting her deliberation. "Do you have a preference?"

"I should like to visit with her."

"Very well. I will confirm when a convenient time might be and have that information communciated to you."

"Convenient for her? What about me?"

"Beg your pardon, your majesty, I only meant that there ware so many small details to attend to today. I was to avoid the appearance of interruprted anythin in this carefully planned schedule."

The Queen could feel anger bubbling up inside her. She had not felt this way in quite some time, and assocaited the feeling with being younger. Unlike then, she could tamp down the feeling, probably closer to stomp down on it forcefully, to ensure that she did not say something that might be used against her later. So, she simply smiled and said curtly, "Indeed."

As if understand what this short word and the tone it was delivered in meant, the priest excused himself and went about the business of confirming a time for the Queen to pay her respects.

After the priest left, she sat in her room for most of the morning reading, writing letters, and observing her surroundings from the windows in her room. Occassionaly a citadel servant or one of her own would check on her. Once she waved them away, she would inevitably feel overlooked, uninvolved in th bustle that was clearly going on around her.

Eventually her handler returned to tell her that the candidate was ready. He led her and her small retinue to another level of the citadel, one closer to the space where the events today would take place. 

Whereas she had felt like someone sitting on the very wdge of the whirlpool, but only feeling slight ripples of its massive power, on this level, near the candidate's room, she started to feel the tide ripping and pulling around her. Everyone she saw had a nearly paniked look on their faces.

Then the door to the candidate's room opened, and she met another serene face. Two faces in fact. Lord Burrington sat on the edge of a bed opposite from theis young woman.

The young woman bowed and Lord Burrington nodded his hear to her. She looked at thim, surprised that he was here. "Lord Burrington, I was not expectign you."

"Yes, I am helping my young protege about some of the finer points the momentous transition she is undertaking."

"Excellent. May I have a moment along with the candidate?" the Queen asked. She saw a look pass between the two, with Lord Burrington give the young woman the subtlest of nods. 

He stood up and mockingly curtseyed before her then left the room.

"Do you know why I am here, child?" the Queen asked, opting to project herself as a concerned, caring aunty.

"I am afraid I don't your majesty."

"Well, as you know we didn't have a chance to properly meet before."

"Yes, your majesty. It was terrible. My poor mother cried for the better part of the day."

"And you?"

"I beg your pardon, about what me your highnesss?"

"Did you cry for the better part of the day, as you put it?"

"Do not think less of me, but no I did not. Again, while I may have wished that unfortunate young woman well, the stakes are too high."

"What stakes are those?"

"The stakes of waering the robe, of observing. Lord Burrington has told me all about and about how improtant the memories and stories are. We all knew going in to the select process that nothing was guaranteed. Besides many things in life carry with them risk or the potential death."

The Queen was surprised by how intimately familiar with the cloak and observer this young woman seemed to be, and how freely she spoke of Lord Burrington. The Queen would feel forces that she could not see and, perhaps, did not fully understand, moving in and out and round this candidate. Everywhere she looked, it seemed, were things in her surroundings that she had not seen before, things that she had not noticed or had been occulted from her view.

She was ready to take her leave already, and assumed that she could do so with risking any breach of decorum. So, she stood and said to the young woman, "I must take my leave now. I know you are very busy today. I look forward to learning more about you during our journey."

"What journey might that be, your majesty?" the young woman asked, seemingly not out of insolence but genuine confusion.

"The journey back to my home and the court, to your future home as well," the Queen replied.

The young woman looked very awkwardly over the Queen's shoulder, as if wishing that Lord Burrington was back in teh room, "I am afraid there may have been some misunderstanding, your majesty. I understood that I was to stay here in the citadel for a time. I was already allowed to choose my quarters and select a maid and everything. Were you not aware?"

The Queen forced a small smile, "Of course, it must have slipped my mind. I am happy to hear that you will well cared for by the priests. Perhaps we will have an opportunity to become better acquainted in the not too distant future."

"I sincerely wish for that, your majesty."

***

The time came at last for the day of ceremonies to being. Her handler came to fetch her and her attendants. He led her to an antechamber just outside the ceremonial hall where everything would take place. From outside the ceremonial hall, she could already hear sounds that seemed to blend chanting and singing together.

A loud bell rang out and the hall fell silent. The handler appeared at the door to the antechamber and announced it was time for the Queen to enter the hall.

She regretted the fact that she had let her head dressmaker convincer her to wear a dress with a train, a feature she normally avoided, finding them distracting. But the head dressmaker had insisted that this train would be fasionable and make a statement. As she walked into the hall, the only statement she felt like she was making was that she required help to walk properly and could only inch along at the pace of the attendant holding the end of the train.

She had to traverse the entire length of the hall, which was large with soaring ceilings held up by large columns and seemingly massive stones ribs in the ceiling. The hall was already filled with priests, with lords and their retinues. Everyone stood as she entered, as they had been instructed to do. 

She had been instucted to move to the front of the hall then turn to the left. She would be sitting in the first row of pews there, but notably not in a throne. Her advisers had tried to negotiate this point, that it was improper for the monarch to sit anywhere else. The contingent of priests who had been delegated to make these negotiations with her people insisted that there was only one throne in the ceremonial hall, and that was reserved for the High Priests. 

She walked intently, looking forward, not making eye contact as her mother had instructed her so long ago to do. "Royals do not look upon their subjects, their subjects look upon them," she could hear her mother saying. She couldn't help but see Lor Burrington's large party standing alongside him, very near to the front, but on the opposite side of the hall from where she would be sitting. She could also begin to hear feet shuffling and scrapping on the stone floor; people were growing impatient of standing, even if their upper bodies tried not to betray this fact.

Finally, she reached the first row of pews and pivoted to sit. Her train nearly caught on the corner of the pew. She started to lurch forward, but caught herself. Her attendant had to presence of mind to furl the train so it cam loose and hid the fact that she was really trying to free the train from the old wood leg.

Once she sat down, she knew that the Regents of the Order would enter last. There were six seats arranged on the dias ahead of her, arranged around the high chair where the priests, once appointed would take his position.

The Regents caused another delay due to their age. They shuffled in together as a group. Only one of the Regents at the end of the line seemed to walk with a more able bodied stride.

Two priests stepped forward to help the regent at the head of the line step up on the dias and helped lower him into his chair, just to the left of the center chair. The others took their seats once their leader was seated.

Another priests, a very younng man, placed a hand bell in the head Regent's hand to announce the beginning of the ceremony. The bell was very faint at first and nearly fell from the old man's hand. The young priest gripped the Regent's hand in his own and rang the bell loudly. 

Everyone else in the hall sat now. A few dry coughs broke the silence that followed, but only lasted for a moment. More chanting or singing began. The Queen looked up and saw that above the dias, were a group of priests arranged in a series of tiers who were signing.

When the sining ended, the head Regent started to speak, whispered really, in a dry raspy whisper. The Queen, sitting as close as she was, could barely make out the words. 

The words themselves seemed not to matter as much as the fact that the High Regent was speaking. He paused momentarily and she could hear the large doors to the hall start to open. But the head regent spoke again, and the sound stopped.

At last the head regent ended his speech and waved a trembling hand at the priest. The seemingly younger Regent stood. He was still gray haired and aged, but seemed postively robust in comparison. He stood and walked to the edge of the dias, in a loud commanding voice he called out, "The Regents of the Order are not prepared to consider and accept the one who was stepped forward to be considered for High Priest."

The doors opened fully and the crowd stood again. The Queen had been instructed to remain seated, which she did, not wanting to negotiate any issues with her dress. This mean, though, that she was not able to see the candidate walking down the center aisle until he stood at the foot of the dias.

The candidate stopped before stepped up, his back to the hall. The candidate seemed young, much younger than the Regents. In fact, she was almost surprised by how young he seemed. The head regent feebly rang the bell again and the candidate turned to face the hall.

He turned and addressed the room, "I am presented myself to the Regents to be considered for the position of High Priest. I will recount my accomplishments that qualify me for this position."

The candidate did indeed begin to recite his qualifications, but the Queen hardly paid any attention to that. She was distracted by the fact that she recognized the young man presenting himself as candidate. Lief was the young man standing there to be considered as the next High Priest of the Order.

After he finished his recitattion, each member of the regents recited some formulaic text and then gave his judgment. They were all unanimously in favor of the young man's candidacy. 

Then two priests appeared from the wings of the dias carrying large boxes. She had been told ahead of time that each box contained a ring--rings that the high priest wore for the duration of his time in that position. 

She was called forth to place one of these rings on his fingers. She approached the dias, trying not to lock eye contact with him. It wouldn't have mattered, becuase the young man was completely absorbed in the moment. He seemed to not be aware of the particulars of what was happeneing before him. 

The Queen took the ring that was presented to her, a large ring with the symbol of a crown embossed in it, and moved to place the ring on his hand. He did not smile or nod or make any recognizable gesture of recnogization or intimacy. She might as well have been facing a stranger. 

After all, perhaps she was facing a stranger. She had had a fun afternoon picnicing and laughing with a young boy who seemed to have not grasped the weight of what was about to happen to himm. Grasping that weight seemed to have changed him, even transformed him into the person who seemed distant and cold now, who had seemed almost hostile the night before. 

His strange tone last night made more sense now. But even now that she knew he was, in fact, the very candidate she had asked and speculated about, there was been and undercurrent, not just of hostility, but even agression in the way he spoke to her.

She didn't have long to consider this, though. Once the ring was placed on his hands, he turned to face the regents. The oldest regent waved him forward; he took his first step up onto the dias. He took another step, kneeled before the head fo the chairs who, once again with assistance, placed the second ring on his finger.

With that he stood up, turned to face the hall again. He began to recite a long passage in a language she did not understand. She could only assume it had to do with the passage he was reading and studying the night before.

With the recitation completed, he sat down in the chair that had, up to now, been empty. He sat down and became the new High Priest of the order.

***

After the ceremony, the Queen's handler appeared at her side and whispered, "The High Priest would like a word with your majesty in his private study."

"I was planning to retun to my quarters to rest before the robing ceremony. Can it wait?

The handler shifting uncomfortably, "The High Priest was very insistent."

Deciding that it was best not to antagonize the new High Priest mere minutes into his reign, she replied. "Yes, yes of course. She wondered what business he could have and what would be so urgent.

The handler led her down a series of halls to an open door. She stepped inside to a spacious office lined in bookcases, dotted with artifacts, and other seemingly priceless objects. The new High Priest was standign by the windows. He turned to her. 

"I apologize that I did not say anything last ngith to you about my candidacy. I hope that was not awkward for you."

"No not awkward, I understand that there are customs and ways of doing things that you hold tightly."

He nodded and looked around this room. "I remember being brought to this very room when I first arrvied at the Citadel. I just just a boy, not long before i met you for the first time. I was terrified."

"Of course, you were just a child."

He didn's acknowledge her comment but continued on, "Look at this place. A learned person must inhabit a place like this. A person with a strong will, who holds sway over the world. An important person. A powerful person." She thought perhaps this was a bit overstated, but he took his point and didn't want to stoke an argument on this momentous day.

"And now I am here. This room...this place is mine."

"And the power too."

"Yes, the power too."

"What do you plan to do with it?"

"That is what I wanted to discuss with you, or at least in part."

"Please, I am listening."

"It has come to my attention that the candidate, once robed, must be sent immediately to the western frontier. There are great disturbances there and they must be captured so we cmay learn from them."

"The west? We have only just brought the western lands into the kingdom. I...I am not aware of any disturbances."

The High Priest began to pace, his arms drawn back behind his back. Was he feigning concern and seriousness? She couldn't tell. "All the more reason that she be sent at once."

"Traditionally that has been the monarch perogative."

"In consultation with the High Priest."

"Perhaps, but..."

"And I am consulting you."

"I think you are informing me."

He looked at her, "An insignificant difference in meaning."

She decided to go ahead and lob the information she learned from the candidate into the conversation. "I only recently learned that the observer won't be residing in my household."

"Yes, that was Lord Burrington's wish. As well as my own."

"There is no precedent for it."

"There is not precedent for a man of my age to be high priest. And yet here I am."

"But this arrangement disorganizes the relationship between the priests and the crown."

"Perhaps it is due for some disorganization," he replied.

At that moment, none other than Lord Burrington appeared in a paneled side door in the office. Had he been listening to their conversation, she wondered. He sliced through the conversation with a hearty, "Congratulation, your highness. A wonderful feat. So many great things to come. Don't you agree, your majesty?"

The queen smiled in reply.

"I was just sharing with the Queen that my first formal order as High Prest will be to dispatch the obvserver to the western frontier."

"Yes excellent news. The kingdom is hungry for stories, for news, no...for understanding of what is happening around it. I couldn't have devised a better plan myself"

The Queen looked at them both. She could feel that she had lost her advantage in the situation and would have to accept this course of action. She could not, however, quite put into thoughts for herself how or why this was happening. Nonetheless, something was slipping from her grasp.

"Well, then," she replied. "now that I have informed of your plan, I suppose the only thing left to do is to complete the robing ceremony."

"Indeed," the High Priest replied. "I look forward to seeing you soon."

***

The Queen had insisted on changing before the robing ceremony. She did not want to be dragged down by the train and complicated dress. She knew that her changing would not raise much attention. Besides, she hoped that changing would help her change her outlook on what was happening around her.

When she first reentered the ceremonial hall, she felt that maybe the change had, in fact, helped. The ceremonial hall felt very different from how it had felt earlier in the day. There were many fewer people, mostly just a contingent of priests in the room. Her place in the room was more central and prominent. 

Nevertheless, everywhere she looked, the Queen could not help but see symbols of the priests' power and influence. Nothing illustrated this better than the young woman herself, the candidate who was brought into the hall for the ceremony. She did not, in fact, seem nervous or uncertain. She did not look to the Queen for any reassurance. In fact, she hardly seemed to take notice of the Queen at all.

This ceremony began similarly to the last one as well. The regents entered the hall again, only this time, they were led by the High Priest. The new High Priest did not seem to realize at first that they was walking a two or three strides ahead of the elderly regents, and had to slow down once of twice, after glancing back over his shoulder and becoming aware of the distance.

The regents and the High Priest took their places on the dias. The High Priest called for the candidate to come forward. The young woman approached the High Priest and bowed her head.

Finally, another line of priests entered the hall. The Queen wasn't sure what their purpose was at first. She realized, though, that one of the priests in the middle fo the line was carrying something, perhaps a jar with something in it. The priests walked deliberately, slowly, particuarly the one in the middle. He seeemed very focused on the thing he was carrying and did not want to disturb its contents.

The line stopped in front of the candiate when fanned out to form a half circle around her, enclosing the candidate with the barrier they created. She could make out the priest holding something as he approached the dias and the High Priest. Another priest beside the high priest took the jar or container and held it firmly in his grip.

Another priest stepped up and stood on the other side of the high priest. This one had something drapped over his arms. She looked it carefully and realized it was the cloak, the same cloak that Avalon had shown her so many years ago. The Queen, of course, knew that this was the robing ceremony and that the candidate would be given the robe, but she had not seen it in so long that her mind was suddenly on fire with memories.

The ceremony commenced, much like the last one, with the priests reciteing passages in various languages. After several minutes of this, the High Priest nodded to the priest holding the container. The High Priest reached in to the container and grabbed what was inside of it. He held up the object, which must have been suspended in some kind of fluid, above his head. It dripped slightly and the fluid ran down his arm.

The Queen looked at it closely and realized that the thing in his hands was an eye, a large moving eye that was scanning the room, widly moving back and forth, seemingly taking in everything it saw around it. She nearly recoiled in horror, not having an idea that the priests somehow extracted the eyes and saved them, or did something with them.

Still holidng the wildly moving eyes, the High Priest began to say, "Look in my hands, and you will see the thing that animates and preserves us. Our words are like sand, but what the eye sees, the eye does not forget. Please bring the candidate forward."

The young woman took several steps forward. "It is time the robes to be placed on your shoulder, many others have worn these robes before you. Many others have performed this sacred duty before you. Are you prepared to be just one of many?"

The young woman unflinchingly said, "I am ready"

Once the cloak was placed around her shoulders, the High Priest continued, "Please turn so that your sight may be awakened." The young woman turned, facing the half circle of priests. The High Priest stepped down from the dias and began chanting, staring at the eye intently, as if trying to master its wild vision with his will. He brought the eye down and close to his body, bowing his head over it. He lifted it aloft one more time. The entire hall of priests said serveral words in a langauge she didn't understand. They held their hands aloft as if mimicking the High Priest. He then thrust his hands out and seemed to touch the eye to the cloak. 

When he stepped back, his hands were empty. The half circle parted and the woman began walking forward parting thier ranks and the ranks of priests in the room. As she walked, the Queen could see that the eyes on the cloak had all awoken and were all looking around, searcing for things to see, to record and report.

# Chapter 7: Take a Chance With Me #

Without even thinking about it, the Queen pounded her fist on the long table where her royal advisers adn officers sat. "I want to know what the High Priest and Lord Burrington are hiding. It has been months now since the robing ceremony and we have heard nothing from them. And All that I am hearing is excuse making. It must stop."

Her senior adviser, who she wished had been barred from the room, addressed the room, "Your Majesty, I am sure this is nothing more than a misunderstanding. Let me send representatives to the High Priest and Lord Burrington as proxies for your majesty to better understand what is happening."

"What is happening is that something is shifting in the kingdom. Power is out of balance and you, all of you, have allowed this to happen. You pleged oath of fealty to the crown, you are servants of the crown. Without the crown, what are you?"

The Queen's spymaster spoke up, "Your majesty, our networks have gove silent. We are hearing nothing, learning nothing."

"Then create a better network. I am not a spymaster; I do not excel at spycraft." The senior advisor sighed heavily. "Do you have something you with to add?"

"I do not but the Crown's Treasurer surely does."

The Treasurer was a nervous man, who rarely spoke in these meetings. He shuffled his papers as a preamble to speaking. "Please Lord Treasurer go on. What bad news do you have to deliver?"

"The bad...bad news your highness, is that the Crown's coffers are not as full as they once were."

"And why is this? Why has nothing been said to me? Shouldn't expanding the kingdom bring more, not less, revenue?"

"Spending, certainly. Spending is an issue. And...and our tax collectors. They are being run out of villages. Several heads of houses have refused them entry on their lands."

"That is sedition. Treason. They should be tried and judged."

The adviser interceded, "This is the heart of the matter, your highness. There are no laws by which to take them to trial. The crown's revenue has always been collected on a customary basis, an unspoken agreement between the houses in the kingdom and the monarch."

"Then make it a law."

"We have no mechanicsm by which to do this, I am afraid."

"Then what? What will compell these houses and these places to pay their due to the Crown?"

The room shifted, almost everyone at once, as if they all knew what was about the take place. Again, the Queen realized that she was the last in the line of people to receive and share important information. She knew she couldnt' let her frustration erupt any more than it had. "We may need to find more forceful methods to recuperate what belongs to the Crown..."

"Send soldiers to collect taxes? Is that wise?"

"It would be wisdom conditioned by the circumstances we find ourselves in, your majesty."

The Queen turned to the commander of regular forces. "And what of this plan?"

The gruff commander replied, "Your majesty, the soldiers have not been paid in many months. Many have deserted and returned home. We are a barebones force right now."

"So I need money in order to be able to collect money? Please keep this song away from me, it is spinning my head in circles."

The senior advisor stepped in, "But I believe there may be a solution. I believe we can borrow the sums needed to streghten our force. Lord Malcolm is still loyal to the crown."

"Lord Malcolm was my father's man, who is to say he will support me?"

"I think it is worth exploring, your majesty" the senior advisor replied. "If you will allow me, I will gladly explore this option on your majesty's behalf."

"Very well, we will borrow the necessary sum to pay the soldiers. Commander, please let the word go out that soldiers are to report for duty. I want you to prepare to send a force out west to begin to recuperate what is owned to the Crown.

***

"Lord Malcolm will consider the Crown's request to loan it funds, but with conditions," the senior advisor explained.

"What conditions?" the Queen replied. She had planned to take her regular carriage ride through the town and the great park at the center of the town. She learned that the senior advisor had been very insistent upon joining her, only to find herself waiting in her carriage for the advisor to appear. 

They were now travelling through the section of the park that had been modeled like an enchanted forest from some far away time and some far away place. The trees grew densely here and a winding path unduldated over the gently sloping ground. The horse hoofs clacked on one of the several wooden bridges that were dramatically arched, and very noisy.

The senior advisor learned forward, cupping his hand over his ear to hear better. The Queen lenaed in as well and spoke more loudly, "What conditions?"

"Ah, yes, he insists that you personally call upon him at his residence."

"Call upon him, like some doe-eyed girl about to come out to society? That's bold for someone who has all but fallen out of courtly life. When was the last time Lord Malcolm was seen in public?"

"It has been some time, true, your majesty. But he was very insistent about his desire to your your majesty face to face to confirm the matter."

They left the deeply shaded woods and sun light spilled over her face, causing her to squint and shield her eyes with her hand. The carriage rounded a corner and the sun was less intense. She replied, "Very well, inform Lord Malcom that I will pay my respects."

Within a day, she was traveling again with her party of guards and attendants to Lord Malcom's estate and house. The Queen had vague memories of Lord Malcom from her childhood. For a period of time, he had been a frequent guest in their home. She could remmeber watching as her father and his guest rode out on horseback on days-long hunting expeditions. 

Eventually he appeared in their home less frequently. She was never sure why though. She knew from her parents whisperings that Lord Malcolm remained loyal to the Crown, but something had come between him and her father.

Lord Malcom's house was one of the wealthier houses in the kinddom, though the austere appearnace of his estate did not suggest this fact at all. The Queen was surprised, in fact, by how simple, even bland and tasteless, everything was as they approached the Lord's house. 

The house itself was large, to be sure, but of a very plain design with very little ornamentation in the stone work. There were chimneys everywhere, but only a few seemed to be active with plumes of curling smoke.

She was surpised to be led to the lord's chambers for their face-to-face meeting, and not some parlor or more formal meeting place. A servant opened the door as the Queen approached, and she immediately understood why.

A large bed was positioned in the middle of room. And old haggard man lay in it, propped up in bed, being fed his lunch by a attendant. Next to the bed stood a man, older than her, but only by a few years. She could tell that the man was the lord's son since the younger man looked more like her memories of Lord Malcolm than the old man sitting in bed.

It was the younger man, however, who stepped around the bed and bowed to greet the Queen. As he introduced himself, his father continued to eat. "Welcome your majesty, we are both glad you agreed to visit." As is self-concsious that his father was still eating, the son added, "My father must maintian a very strict regimine of diet and exercise in his current condition. He will be finished momentarily."

"That is quite alright," the queen replied. 

"Please, sit with me," the younger man said, guiding her around the bed to two chairs that had already been set up for them. After the Queen sat, the younger man sat as well and said, "I must admit that we were both relieved to learn of your request."

"Relieved? Why relieved?"

The younger man looked at his father and then back at the Queen, "We have started to hear things, rumors. We already had concerns based on what the records were saying."

"What do you mean by records?"

"The records, the stories recorded by teh observer."

"I see."

"I had suggested before that we approach your majesty with an offer to assist the Crown financially if needed, or in other ways, but my father brushed aside the suggestion."

The Queen thought to herself that it was probably wise that they had done so. She would not have taken kindly to learning that Lord Malcolm was prepared to bail her out of her troubles. It was would have seemed presumptious to her, even if the spirit behind it had been well-intentioned.

"Your father would never have allowed such a thing," another voice cut in on their conversation. It was a quiet voice, but a clear and proud one. The Queen looked over to the bed and saw that Lord Malcolm was finished with this lunch and was being sat up more to see and speak more clearly. 

She stood up and approached the bed, deciding to brush aside any annoyance that these two men had been contriving ways to help her without her knowledge, "Lord Malcom, it is good to see you. I was not led to belive that you are unwell."

"The years have not been kind to me, your majesty. But my physicians have helped prolong my time in ways that I do not find too disagreeable."

"I am happy to hear that."

"You've met my son, I see."

She looked back at the man in the chair, "Indeed. And thank you again for welcoming me into your home." The son smiled in reply. She worried suddenly that their urgency to bring her here was some kind of matrimonial ploy. 

"Of course, I am only happy to that you extended your hand to me. I have felt distanced from the Crown for a long time now. I have continued to perform my duty, to uphold the oaths I took, but doing has cost me much."

"Lord Malcolm, I cannot answer for my father's action, especially when, as in this case, his actions are not known to me. Is there something I can do make amends for whatever might have happeened?"

The men looked at each other. The younger man stood and stepped closer to the bed, "In fact, that gets to the heart of why why we asked you to travel here."

"And here I am..."

Lord Malcolm spoke up, "Your majesty, may I speak plainly, candidly what weighs on my mind?"

His son replied, "Father, are you sure this is wise."

The Queen cut in, "Please, Lord Malcom, even as a girl I did not like it when people were avoided telling me the truth. Please tell me what weighs on your mind in as unvarnished a manner as you are able to."

"As you may know, a rift occured between your father and myself."

"I assumed as much, but never knew why."

"The rift was over you, your majesty. You were the cause."

"Me? What did I do? I don't recall any breach in etitquette or any offence I might have given you."

"No, you were a spirited child to be sure, but it was nothing you did. Rather it was something your father did in relation to you."

"And what was that?"

"I objected to way he let you cultivate a relationship with the observer, with Avalon, as you called her."

She found it hard to believe that after so many years this issue was surfacing again, and in such an unlikely venue. "I was just a child. The relationship was innocent enoguh."

"Of course your majesty. I am not making my meaning clear enough. My concern had more to do with how your father let you become familiar with the obverser, treat the observer like a friend. Historically that was not the role the observer was meant to have in the monarch's household. There was supposed to be distance. The observer was an instrument to acheive an end, not a vessel for friendship and affection."

"Couldn't both have been possible?"

"Perhaps, but your relationship with Avalon meant that your parents kept the truth of her nature and her place in our lives secret from you, or at least obscured. Again, please pardon me for being so forthrigh. I do not mean any disrepsect towards your mother and father, but in this area, I feel they did not judge the sitiation correctly. I spoke up an asserted my opinion and this led to the rift with your father."

"I see", the Queen replied. "I thank you for your honesty, but I am still confused to what end you are being honest. What purpose does this honesty serve?"

The son started to speak, but paused. "Go ahead and explain our thoughts," the father said.

The son continued, "There are certain secrets, certain knowledge that we have that we feel you should have. We have hesitated until now to share this knowledge with you. Learning that the Crown was searching for loans, needing support, concerned us and made us feel that you must have this knowledge if you are to continue on."

"And what knowledge would this be?"

"Knowledge about the observer and the cloak and what happens to the stories she records."

***

Lord Malcolm required rest after their conversation. The Queen felt that she needed time to reflect on what had transpired as well. Although it was unsettling to learn that this man and his son had some special knowledge they felt they needed to impart on her, it confirmed her feeling that throughout her reign certain things had been obscured and kept from her.

Finally the appointed time came for them to reveal what they were going to reveal. The son entered the parlor where the Queen was taking tea. "My father will be down momentarily. He insisted on accompanying us, even in his weakened condition. Unfortunately in this old house, we have to have the grounds staff carry him down."

"I am sorry that his conditioned is so deteriorated. It has been so long."

"Yes."

"Do you have something you wish to say?"

"I do, your highness, but I hesitate to say it."

"I am here, at your invitation. I have opened myself up to your honesty thus far and have taken offence. Have I not proven myself to be a willing accepter of the truth?"

"Yes, and it is commendable, your highness. Perhaps even surprising."

"Why surprising?"

"There is a view, your highness. In the kingdom. Of the Crown...and of you?"

"And you will acquaint me wtih this view?"

"I would like to you, yes."

"What view is that?"

"The view is that your highness is too removed from the affairs of the Crown and the kingdom. That you are not well-acquainted with every day affairs."

"I feel I must take exception to this, I do nothing but devote my days to the kingdom's business. If only I could recount for you the hours lost in meetings and so on."

"I understand, your highness. I do not mean to suggest that you are not hardworking or serious about your role, please understand me. It is only that starting with your father, perhaps even before, there was been a certain withdrawl, and unwillingness to see what is really happening in the kingdom."

"And you intend to correct this."

"Pardon me. I don't mean to suggest that I or my father can correct something that you are doing. We merely wish to provide you with information we fear you are lacking, that we fear has been withheld from you for too long."

"Very well then, I would very much liket to learn this informatino first hand, rather than continue talking about it.

At this point, Lord Malcolm appeared downstairs and was ready to accompany them to wherever they were going. 

They traveled by carriage roughly eastward from the house. After an hour or so of traveling, the Queen could see a tower rising above the treeline in the distance. They forded a shallow winding creek and then disappeared into a tangle of forest. Then the forest cleared and there emerged the tower. It was extremely tall, with large stones anchoring it at the base, and four-sided, though the edges protouded out to make rounded corners. 

They alighted from the carriages and the Queen looked straight up the height of the tower, straining to see the top. "What is this place?"

The son, passing her as he approached the entrance. "This is the archive, your majesty."

Inside they met another man who was older than Lord Malcolm's son by at least ten years. He was introduced as the archivist, who oversaw and organized the archive. The Queen immediately noticed a familial resemblance, confirmed once the son added, "And my older brother."

The older brother, the archivist, bowed and said, "Your majesty, I am happy that you are here, though i fear it is long overdue."

"So I am learning today. I seem to have be untimely in most of my affairs these days."

Lord Malcom spoke up, "Leave the Queen be, my son. We have much to discuss and should not waste time on squabbles."

"Father, I do not think that acknowledging that the Crown's lapse of interest in the archive is wasting time."

"Lord Malcom, it is quite alright. I appreciate that you have instilled such forthrightness in your sons."

"I credit my late wife, your highness. She had more moral courage than me, I am afraid to say."

"In any case, I know you are anxious to being my lessons, why first I must ask, What is this place?"

The older son almost seemed aggreieved by the question, but he answered it all the same, "Your majesty, this is the repository of all the stories we collect form the observer."

"I thought the priests performed that function."

"No your majesty, the priests merely extract the stories. They developed and stablized a process. They are mere intermediaries, technicians if you will. We perform the hard work of transfering and preserve them."

"Transfer?"

The younger son stepped in, "I would like to suggest that we start with the preserve part and work our way."

"If that is your wish," the older son replied.

The father spoke up, "It is my wish."

"Qery well, father."

"One more question before we continue, and pardon my ignorance, but how long has the archive been here?"

Lord Malcom replied, "Many, many years. Our family was trusted with the honor and responsibility ot build the archive, to house it, and protect it. This is a burden we gladly take on for the Crown, for the kingdom, as a sign of our fealty to the Crown."

"And to the veractiy of the archive," the older son added.

The tour finally commenced. The tower contained a series of mechanical platforms with operators who manipulated a series of counter weights and pullies to rise and lower the platform. The Queen felt a spell of dizziness almost overtake her as the platform rose up into the sky. They stopped and transered platorms before they reached the top of the tower. 

A guard stood in front of a large vault door at the top floor. The guard opened the door after the archvist gave him a signal. They stepped inside a spacious room filled with shelves from floor to ceiling. The shelves were split into small boxes or bays that contained rolls and rolls of paper that had been tied up and stacked on top of each other. Not all of the boxes were filled evenly, which indicated that there was some sort of organizational principle at work here, even though her untutored eye could not detect it in a passing glance.

The archivist waved his hand, "Your highness, you are seeing some of the earliest stories that were collected by the woman in the robe. Many of these narratives are incomplete, some of confusing or misleading. We did not fully understand the intricacies of transcribed what the robe had recorded. Nonetheless, you will find many of the momentous events that led to the kingdom's establishment housed here."

"So the stories of my ancestorss..."

Lord Malcom replied, "Are saved here, many of them at least. There are stories of our family too, though the mentions are more fleeting and taking a keen eye to find. But even in those early days, when my family were burgeoning farmers and land owners, our fates were bound up with each other."

The Queen went to take a scroll from one of the shelves at random. The archivist nearly lunged forward to stopped her, "Your majesty, I must ask that you refrain from doing that. We have a very careful system for tracking the scrolls and where they are. Perhaps at another date, we could arrange a time for to consult a sample of them."

"I would like that very much, perhaps this evening."

"Yes, perhaps..." the archivst trailed off, clearly not enthusiastic about having to gather together materials on such a short notice. 

They continued on their tour by going back down the platform. After they descended ten or so floors, the plaform stopped again and they all stepped off. On this floor were a series of doors, no guards and no vaults. They passed through the doors and entered more rooms with shelves and scrolls.

The archivist led the party down several rows and shelves, through a door, down more more rows, and another door. They turned one more corner and the Queen realized that the bin where the archivst poitned was empty. In fact the bins in this area were not as densely packed with scrolls as others she had seen on the tour. "This is where the archive ends."

"That's the present?" the queen asked, looking at the empty space, or near empty space, there was one scroll laying askance in the other wise empty space. 

The younger son answered this time, "Not exactly, your majesty. That is as far as the archive goes. We are still working to process stories that were collected--it is an arduous process. But as you can see the output became more and more inconsistent and has slowed down significantly."

"We went some time without an observer, I know."

"Which will inevitably lead to gaps in the archive..." the archivist interjected.

The younger son continued, "What my brother says is too. And, yes, the discontinuity in the role did affect how many scrolls were producted. But it was also a harvesting issue?"

"Harvestting issue? How so?"

"Perhaps we should move on to the final part of the tour. You will understand my meaning better then."

***

Once they reached the ground floor, they passed through a door that opened up onto a small staircase that led underground. The sons tried to encourage their father nto to come down, but he wouldn't hear of it. A servant helped him mount and traverse the stairs one at a time, very deliberately.

Once they were downstairs, the Queen was surprised by what she saw. They were standing in a long hall. On each side of the hall were wooden doors. There seemed to be another staircase down at the end of the hall.

"What is behidn these doors?"

"Harvesting," was the archivest's response. "Before we venture further, I must warn you, your majesty, that you may not like what you see."

"I am prepared for anything."

"Very well." the archivest led them down the hall, four or five doors. He knocked lightly at the door and began to open it. The door squaled and whined like it didn't want to be opened. They all waited in the hall and gestured for the Queen to enter.

She almost gasped and stumbled back when she stepped into the room. It seemed as if a cyclops was staring back at her, as if the archivest and his father and brother had captured a mythological creature and was holding it hostage in this tall imposing tour.

Once the shock and surprise wore off, we realize that, staring back at her, was a man sitting at a table with pen and paper in front of him. He had a device of leather pieces and buckles strapped to his face. Seated somehow in the front was a single large eyeball that blicked and moved and looked around the room.

The eyeball was so large and the Queen so close to it that she could see its large dark pupil narrow from the influx of feeble light from the hall.

The man sat with this contraption on his face, seemingly unbothered by the whole thing. As they eye moved and shifted, the Queen realized that it wasn't looking at her. It was almost as if it was reenacting the movements it had made when it saw some event to record. In fact, the man was rapidly writing something down on the paper in front of him as the eye moved. When the eye paused, then man stopped writting. Then it began again and the writing commenced.

Finally, the eye stopped for good and the man stopped writing. He reached up and extracted the eye from the mount in front of his face. The Queen felt quesy as she saw how the eye's soft substance gave a little under the pressure of the man's grip. He kept it firmly in his hands htough and returned it to jar that was also on the table, though she only just now noticed it. The eye plopped into the fluid like a fish being returned to the water, and bobbed up and down for a moment before settling into a lazy float in the middle of the fluid.

The man rubbed his eyes and blinked at the Queen. Lord Malcom and his sons entered the small room. Lord Malcom addressed the recorder, "Tell us what you saw."

The man spoke in a quiet whisper, "It is very much like the others. Troubling. Confused and cloudy."

The older brother anxiously cut in, "Were there gaps, like the others?"

"Yes, my lord. Gaps, ellissions. Cutting and scraping away. The visions were thin, somehow, lacking depth and detail. Much is obscured and unclear." They stood in silence for a moment. "Pardon me my lord but I fear I must retire now and rest."

The recorder stood silently and brushed passed them, leaving the room. Lord Malcolm turned to her, "Recording is exhausting work. It requires intense mental and physical concentration. Typically a recorder must rest for half a day before being able to work again."

Two more people entered the room. One put a cloth over the container with the eye and removed it from the room. The other rolled up the papers, placing them in a leather tube. This person also hung up the seeing apparatus and tidied up the room. The other person who tidied up the room handed the archivist the tube. 

The archivest explaining, "The archivist reviews the recording for clarity, sometimes for fidelity. At times, I must review the recordings as well, when something in the recording seems confusing or misleading." The Queen noticed, looking at the archivst as he spoke that he had lines and wrinkled etched into his face where the mask must be when he wears it. 

The younger son turned to the Queen, "Father is due for a rest. Let's return to the house and we can finalize any matters that need to be finalized."

They returned to the archive's entrance. The older brother stood in the center of the space with his arms crossed behind his back. "Thank you for your visit your majesty. I hope it was worth your time."

"I would say that it was. And I would very much like to see some examples of those scrolls at your earliest convenience."

"Yes, your majesty. I will prepare soemthing for you. You mentioned this evening?"

"If your father does not objects to my visit being prolonged."

Lord Malcolm replied, "This is important work, your majesty. Take all the time you need."

***

The fact that Lord Malcolm normally ate a very early dinner and retired early worked well for the Queen. After the simple meal, the Queen announced that she would like to walk to the archive for her consultation. 

"May I join you?" the younger son asked.

"I would like that very much, though fair warning I am prone to long spells of silence and introspection when I walk."

They did, in fact, walk in silence for much of the way. Occassionaly the son would point out a noreable feature of the landscape, a particular tree he and his brother used to play under, or the barely visible foundations of one his early ancestral homes. 

The Queen nodded with interest, though her mind was far away. She continued to think over what she had seen today and knew what she had a long carraige ride ahead of her in the morning. She particularly wanted to understand Lord Malcom's motiviation brining her here to meet him and show her the archive. She still couldn't see how the loan she desired was connected to the urgency of their request.

As they walked, she dwelled on what the recorder had said before leaving the room. She broke her silence by commenting, "I cannot help but think about what the recorded said about the recording he reviewed. He seemed troubled by the recording. Something is clearly wrong, from what the he explained."

The younger son answered, "Yes, we have noticed a troubling trend in the last few months from the recordings we have receiving. As we said, the volume has lessened considerably, and the quality... If my brother were here he would say that they are deeply flawed, perhaps outright lies."

"He takes the integrity of the archive seriously."

"Indeed, he does. In any case, we are concerned by how the quality and character of the recordings have changed since the new oberserver was robed."

"Why wasn't this brought to my attentino sooner?"

"We were unsure how to broach the subject, unsure if perhaps these changes reflected some directive from the Crown itself."

"I have not had any contact with the watcher or the priests since the ceremony."

"Which is a concerned fact in of itself."

"I have felt this way as well, but perhaps it was customary."

"It has happened in times of need, but there is a clear precedent that the observer hews closely to the Crown and the monarch."

"I see, then it seems that, rather than clarifying mysteries, I will leave with more."

"Perhaps so, your majesty. I wish I could offer an explanation, or at least a theory. I can only present you with what we know to be true."

They continued their walk in silence. When they arrived at the tower, the older brother greeted him, though he seemd somewhat flustered to see his younger brother in the Queen's company, though she couldn't understand why that would be the case. 

The younger brother must have noticed it as well and said in a good natured way that he would linger downstairs and wait for the Queen. His brother seemed to accept this as an acceptable arrangement and led the Queen up to the tower's first floor.

He explained as they walked, "Our quarters are on the first and second floor, though these days we are mostly confined to the first floor. There are only a few of the older recorders who still live on the second floor. It proved to be too difficutl to try to relocate them.

"How long do the recorders reside here?" the Queen asked with interest, rememberign the exhausted expression of the recorder she had seen earlier in the day.

"Usually ten years or so before the job is too much to continue on with it."

"Too much?"

"Yes, as we discussed earlier, the job is taxing on the mind, on the eyes. In rare cases we have had recorders who start to...disassociate from reality."

"In what way?"

"They cease to be able to distinguish between the reality they see recorded by the eyes and the reality they see with their own eyes. We see it first in the transcriptions."

"How so?"

"They read differently, confused, rambling. In the most extreme cases, the stories read like an assemblage of words that have been put on a page with little care to how things being and end. During my time, I have striven to improve the quality of the records, and the stories, as much as possible."

"I see, and will I be able to disceren your attention to quality in the texts that I review tonight?"

"I will be intereste to find out. I did not select these samples with that criteria in mind, rather I wanted to give your majesty a sense of the types of stories that are collected here."

"But don't most of these stories make their way out into the world?"

"Not all of them. From time to time, we deem theme unsuitable for circulation."

"I see. Well, I look forward to being scandalized by something."

The archivst retured a weak smile, as if he he felt the Queen's comments trivialized what he was doing. She ignored his passing irritation and attributed it to this abiding commitment to the quality and purpose of his work.

She was taken to a table with several scrolls neatly arranged along the top. Much of the table's top was covered by a soft leather mat. Several heavy snake-looking objects covered in felt sat to one side of the mat. On the other, sat a magnifying lens. 

"Please sit," the archivist said. "The magnifiying glass, as you can probably imagine, is to provide assistance with reading some of the handwritten scrolls. Some of the earlier scrolls are harder to read to due changing hand writing styles and the faded ink. This lamp on the table can be made brighter, but I ask that you not make it too bright. Not good for the scrolls."

"And these?" the Queen asked, letting the heavy velvet snaks roll through her fingers and back on to the table."

"Yes, for weighing down the paper to keep it flat. It helps ensure the paper does not tear, and encourages you to minimize the amount of time your hand spends in contact with the paper."

The queen couldn't help with let an amused smile about the archvist's presentation, but she quickly suppressed it when the archivest turned his attention to her again.

"Of course you are free to choose, but I have arranged these in chronological order from left to right. Whether you start witht the present and work back, or the past and word to the present, you may decide for yourself. Perhaps there is some other chart to course through them. I just left them in the order that seemed easiest to browse."

"I appreciate your attention to detail."

"Of course, your majesty. I have several matters to attend to elsewhere in the castle. One my servants is within earshot should you meed anything."

She scanned the scrolls in front her, deciding to work through them in reverse. As she read through the first few scrolls, she experienced the stories they contains as if through panes of glass. She waded through the dense prose in the scrolls, trying to make sense of the stir of names and places and events. In several instances through, she recognized one of these names or places or events from one of Avalon's stories. The text on the scroll wasn't exactly like the story that Avalon might have shared, but the pieces were there. 

In these moments, Her imagination would reorder the seemingly chaotic version on the page into the more orderly and captivating version that Avalon told her. She could also recall vividly the experience of listening the Avalon tell her stories, of being capitvated by the world that she described. She wasn't a queen sitting in chilly stone room anymore; she was a princess hiding with Avalon in a cozy room with a crackling fire. 

It struck her all of a sudden that the scrolls, these later ones that she read first, were produced from scenes that Avalon had seen and recorded. So, even though her memories of the stories Avalon told held such a powerful grip on her imagindation, she also realized that the rougher more jumbled version she read on the page must have been closer to what Avalon saw, what Avalon experienced.

Which was closer to the real Avalon, she wondered? The one captured in these scrolls or the one she kept hidden away in her memories. Even though those moments in her life and those stories wound there way into her daily life, she counscioulsy did not dwell on them or in them that often. She felt that in some sense the version of Avalon she remembered was her childish, childhood version. Now, perhaps for the first time, she could consider Avalon as an adult, perhaps closer to how Avalon would have experienced things.

She savored these complicated feelings, these layers of looking she saw this moment through, before she her fingers trailed over the older scrolls. She began to read through these as well. There was a definite shift in these older recordings towards war and violence. But also building. She continued to read agains the timeline, so her reading inevitably left the impression that all that happened was suppsoed to happen. Reading this way made what was seem inevitable, proper, even good.

As she rolled up the final scroll, she sat back in her chair and tried to lose herself in thought. Before she could, though, the archivist entered the room. He had his arms folded behind his back, much as she had seem him do earlier. "I see you have finished."

"Yes, I have reviewed them all."

"What did you think?"

"I was surprised by how...chaotic some of the recordings were; perhaps complicated is a better word. The stories that we hear and share from these scrolls are simpler, easier to remember and recount."

"Yes, there is a richness of detail that is lost," the archivist replied.

"But sometimes the throughline of the narrative is difficult to find in these narratives. I can't say which is better, but both seem necessary. One wouldn't exist without the other. I must say that I feel a little overwhelmed by the amount of detail in these scrolls. I feel that I need a rest now."  As she started to stand, the Queen noticed archivist had moved his arms in front of him now and that he was holding another scroll. "What is that?"

He tapped his finger on scroll, "This is another scroll. I didn't include it in the others. I wasn't sure if you would want to read anymore."

She looked at him shrewdly and said, "Is this a test of some kind? Am I to pass or fail this test based on my reaction to this scroll."

The archivest looked down at the scroll, "In a manner of speaking, but consider yourself the proctor and the student if it is a test."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning that I do not offer this last scroll to you as some sort of challenge from me to you. Rather it is a challenge that you must present yourself and overcome yourself."

"You seem to be speaking in riddles, but I presume that I should read it now."

"Again, I am only offering it to you. You must take it and decide what to do with it. I will leave it here on the table for you to decide." He sat down the parchment on the very edge of table and left.

She woudl have to lean far to the side to retrive the scroll, but she decided to do it. She had come this far. She knew that she would do well to learn what was being offered to learn."

She grabbed the scroll and sat it directly in front of her. Visually, this scroll looked different from the others she had seen. The older scrolls were not paper, but parchment, much like this one. She reached out to run her fingers over it surface. She could feel the course animal texture of the parchment. It felt related to the others she had read, only this one was rougher, less pristine. Even rolled up the edges were jagged, like it had been a remnant. 

She unrolled the scroll and weighed it down. Unrolled she continued to see more differences. There was only two pieces of parment, but it was thick. It also had not been scrapped well. There were hair follicles from the skin still visible. toward the bottom, she ran a finger over the remnants of a wound that must have healed and made an even coarser and rough edge.

The writing was very difficult to read. This copy had been hastily made. At times there seemed just be broken bits of phrase, random words filling the page. What had the transcribed been thinking, what had caused them to rush so much to put words on the parchment with such abandon, with so little care as to whether or not they would make sense to the person reading those words later on.

She muddled her way through it, but finally picked up the thread. The text described a scene of confusion, and chaos. There had been a battle. Grief and death and destruction was everywhere. Faces seemed to come and go from the narrative. Faces of soldiers, hardened faces that were capable of commiting brutal acts.

There was a tone of uncertainty, even fear in the descriptions, as if the person who originally captured these vision was also terrified, not able to stand apart from the scene, but had been a part of the scene.

She came to a rambling passage as the figure wearing the cloak must have wandered for several days. There were desperate, frantic searches for food. The Queen came to understand that much of this was taking place in teh mountains. There was snow and very little in the area to sustain a person.

There was a blank section on the page, then the story picked up again with the wearer of the cloak being surrounded by figure with chains. They were wrapping the wearer up in chains, dragging the figure behind a horse, through the mountains and down into the plains. There is a journey, a long walk chained to the horse. The soliders neglect the wearer, not offering much in the way of food or water.

Finally they arrive at a castle. The lord of the castle meets the party and gives instructions. The wearer is taken to room, installed by a fire and given food at last. The cloak is taken and put in darkness, presumably in a wardrobe. The last thing it sees is the lord leaving the room and the door closing then locking behind him.

Almost right on cue, the archvisit entered again. "I see you decided to read it." 

"I did, but I do not see how this is some key that unlocks knowledge that I lack."

"This is one of the earliest recordings we possess, if not the earliest. It is crude yes, but crucial to understanding everything that happened afterwards."

"After what?"

"After the first wearer of the cloak, no better yet the maker of the cloak, was captured and made captive by the lord who burned her village to the ground."

"This...this is Griselda's story."

"Yes, part of it, at least the part that no one hears or discusses. There is one subsequent text, we only have a partial copy of it because it was partially destroyed in a fire, but it goes into more...detail about her captivity and the methods used to bring her to heel to serve the lord's purpose."

Then it clicked in the Queen's mind. The throughline suddenly connected up the pieces and she understood. She said out loud, not fully aware that she was doing it, "The lord, the one in Griselda's story. I am that lord's heir. His story is my story. Or at least I am bound to this story. Why don't more people know about this?"

"This scroll has been hidden away for many, meany years, perhaps since the beginning. As the archivist I alone know of its existence and location."

"Your father and brother?"

The archivist shook his head, "Even they don't know. You are the first person I have shared this with since becoming an archivst thirty years ago."

"Then this wasn't part of the plan? why did you chose to show it to me now?"

"I cannot say why, but I feel that you will need this knowledge to see your way through the days that are to come. So that you may confront them with open eyes, not clouded by ignorance. I felt this was my duty as the Crown's archivist."

"Your words are dire and I hope what you saw does not come to pass, but I fear for the worse. Thank you for takign this chance, for sharing this with me."

# Chapter 8: To Turn You On #

"So, I understand that you have returned from a visit with Lord Malcom," were the words welcoming her when she finally arrived back home.

"Lord Burrington, I am surprised to see you. I was not made aware you were expected back in the city any time soon," she replied hoping that she communicated the right amount of exasperation with his presence in her house.

"Yes, my position affords me the ability to move discreetly through the kindgdom when I wish."

"And even into other's houses."

"The Queen's house isn't just any other house, your majesty. It serve as the hub of the kingdom. The monarch's parlor is the kingdom's parlor, if you take my meaning."

She had no choice but to take his meaning, because he was sitting there comfortably in an arm chair, cradling a glass of wine, and reading a book.

"I have only just arrived home and would like to freshen up before I entertain guests."

"Please do not wait on my account. I have nothing but time for your majesty today."

"Very well, then I will return shortly."

As she proceeded upstairs to her rooms, she whispered in a hissing voice to her maid, "Please find out how he was allowed entrance to my house."

"Yes, mam, I will inquire as soon as we're done."

After changing, she sat for moment in her room wondering how she could avoid having to commit her time and attention to Lord Burrington. She still felt a gnawing feeling that he and the High Priest were scheming against her. Her time away had not disspelled or disspirated that feeling at all. 

He was here for some reason, but she didn't have enough information to know for sure, and resigned herself to needing to find out, however unpleasant it might be for her.

She finally returned downstairs to the parlor where she found him browsing the small collection of books in the room. He was casually pulling books from the shelves, flipping through them, and replacing them.

He turned when she entered and commented, "So many interesting titles, and very fine editions."

"Yes, my father retained a binder to bind many of the volumes he enjoyed the best."

"Exqusite work, truly. Commendation to the binder then." He returned to the chair where he had been sitting and picked up the volume left on the small side table. "But this volume, I find myself unable to put it down."

The Queen sat in a small sofa opposite the chair and asked, "And what volume is that?"

Lord Burrington sat as well and replied, "A collection of stories from the observer. Over the years. Fascinating read. And such interesting choice of selections. I see from the front matter than your father was the curator of his collection, as well as the publisher."

"Yes that was one of this interests later in life. He began publishing volumes like that."

"And yet he started out life with something of a warrior's spirit, did he not?"

"I suppose so, though perhaps it isn't so odd that the monarch have something of a martial spirit."

"Pardon my bold question, but do you, your majesty?"

"Have a martial spirit? If the need arises, I suppose I do."

"Interesting. Well, in any case, your father is a testament that life changes us as we live it. From man of war to man of letters. So interesting."

"Lord Burrington, pardon my bold question now, but why are you here?"

"That is an excellent question, your majesty. I am here to help you have some fun. For I am in need of some fun, and what better place is there for pleasure-seekers to be than the city with its places and people. One could quite literally disappear into it and never be seen again."

"What makes you think that I need fun?"

"Because word travels that our Queen spends her days on long dusty trips and sitting in dull meetings. Wasting away her youth. I feel mine slipping away too and mean to stanch the flow for at least a few hours."

"And how do you propose to administer first aid to my youth?"

"Well, I am glad you asked. It just so happens that I am the patron of a wonderful comedy troupe that will performing in the park. After that I happen to know of an artist who is looking for a powerful patron as well."

"I will need to arrange things with my staff and guard."

Lord Burrington groaned and rocked himself forward, "Ah, no, no. That is not it at all. I am proposing to see some of the shining artistic lights of the kingdom in my company and you talk of staff and guards. Let us taste freedom for a few hours."

"So I should sneak out like a young girl chasing after her suitor."

"Your majesty, let's not rush to any premature labels, but yes, in essence, that is what I am saying."

***

When she returned to her room, she complained of a headache and an ongoing sesntivie to noise to her maid, and send her staff and guards away for the night. She dressed herself in a simple dress and preceeded to make her way down the hall and the back stairs that the servants used to traverse the house. The kitchen was empty since the staff would be gathered together playing cards or resting since they had the night off. She almost ran into a scullery maid who was still cleaning the large kitchen fireplace, but managed to slip into a pantry before she was seen.

The Queen could not remember the last time she snuck out of her house. She bregrugindly admitted to herself that she did feel a surge of youthfulness, even though she knew what she was doing was reckless. She told herself that she was playing the role of a spy for the day, one of the spies that the Crown could no longer afford to employ. 

Once outside, she put on a veiled hat that she brought along to obscure her face then started walking down the sloping back alleys until it merged with one of the busy thoroughfares near her house. She paused momentarily knowing that his was her last chance to turn back and shrug off Lord Burrington's invitation. But she convinced herself again that not only was it necessary, but perhaps it would be a welcome distraction from the worries and cares of the last few months as well.

She merged into the foot traffic walking down the crowded sidewalks. Boots and heels clacked on the cobbelstone walk ways. People pushed past her as she jostled up against the throng of people in the city. No one made eye contact with her, which suited her need to be clandestine just fine, and she had to remind herself not to stare at people as she walked. She realized that she had rarely been so close to people, ordinary people in the kingdom before. 

Far from agitating her, the push and pull of the crowd propelled her along, envigorated her. She was found herself fascinated by the small details of the street in ways she rare noted when she was escorted along by her retinue of retainers and guards in a carriage. She noted the styles of buildings that seeemed ot claw at each other for dominance as one style of building replaced another as the fashions of the time dictated. 

She observed windows or doors in high up places that had been bricked over and abondoned, leading her to wonder why. She would stop before being swept along to stare through some small arched opened between buildings that led down a narrow dark walk only to open onto a courtyard where sunlight poured in.

Perhaps it was because she had so recently visited the archive and seen the immense number of scrolls and stories stored there, but she realized that despite its large size ands scale, there was so much that the archive did not house. So many things that the observer didn't see, so much that the monarch did not understand about the land she was supposed to represent, even embody.

She walked to the edge of the park where Lord Burrington waited for her in a small crowd of people. The crowd of people melted away as she approached. She wondered if they knew he was meeting the Queen, or perhaps he had concocted some story about a lady he was meeting in the park. Either way she assumed he had infused his explanation with plumes of scandal for his audience to absorb.

"My lady," Lord Burrington said as a greeting and held out his arm for her like a right and proper gentleman. She took his arm and they entered the park, each playing their appointed role, she thought to herself.

***

They walked through the winding lanes in the park to the center where a stone ampitheater had been built several generations ago. The Queen recalled that outdoor theater had been a great passion for one of her ancestors, hence the creation of this space. They sat high up and towards the back where other people with aristocratic pretensions sat. 

Fortunately they did not seem very out of place among these wealthy audience members. No one seemed to recognize her as well, so she was able to relax and ready herself for the performance.

The show began when two figures came out on stage dressed as a king and queen. Their costumes were crude, but the symbolism was unmistakeable. The king took center stage and made a long speech about his good deeds as king and how wonderful life was in his kingdom. As he spoke, more actors trudged across the stage dressed as downtrodden working people. They passed right around the king but he didn't seem to notice them.

While the king spoke, the actor playing the queen began berating and beating on the peasants who were walking through the stage interrupting the speech. The queen stopped her assault when a third figure appeared on stage. The person wore a long flowing cloak, only rather than being covered in eyes, it was covered in crudely stitched hands. 

The king and queen stepped to the edge of the stage and watched eagerly as the figure in the cloak began to roam among the peasants pick pocketing their belongings. The actors put their acrobatic skills on display as the figure in the cloak would toss increasingly outlandish implements to the kind and queen who caught and balanced them one by one until each was balancing a large pile of the peasant's belongings. The audience gapsed with as each item was tossed then caught. When the cloaked figured disappeared off stage, a short round of applause rippled through the audience.

A younger actor appeared on stage now, dressed like a princess, waltzing and swaying around the stage with seemingly no cares in the world. She too ignored the peasants, but stopped in the middle of the stage and eyed the tower of belongings the king and queen held greedily. In pantomime, the princess urged her parents to give her the belognings. She pleaded and begged. As her pleadings became more wild and more aggressive, the audience laughed more and more.

Finally, the king and queen relented and began tossing the items to the princess who, apparently, was a trained juggler and not only caught the items, but began juggling them and tossing them back to the king or queen. The whole routine became quite elaborate until an actor portraying a priest entered the scene and caused the princess to skip and beat, thus letting all of the items suspeneded in the air fall on her.

The actor portraying the princess put on an exagerated look of disappointment and frustration and began widly kicking and beating her fists on the ground while also twirling in place. More laughs and nods in the crowd over this bit.

The priest waved offstage and more priests appeared. The first priests distributed the items to the priests waiting on him one by one. He led the princess off stage, draggign her by the ear and comically wagging his finger at her. 

The priests exited to the other side. The peasants appeared again, only to be met by the priests who redistributed their belongings. The actors stopped, signaling the end of the scene. Before the actors could bow for their recognition, however, a loud piercing howl split the air and the princess ran across the stage in madcap fashion followed the king and queen, who had lost their crowns and other trappings of royalty and seemed intent on beating the princess with the large sticks they held. 

In her capering, the princess figure ran circles around the king and queen. She avoided being beaten and instead grabbed one of the crowds, evanded her fathers oncoming grip and swipe, and then jumped into and through the audience then disappeared.

The Queen looked around at the laughing and cheering audience. Each face she saw seemed lit up by a gleeful pleasure, a type of pleasure they didn't know they wanted to experience but were happy they were. 

She stood up to take her leave, not wanting to sit through more lampooning of herself or her mother and father. She started down the small uneven path that led back to the central path that curved through the park. Lord Burrington caught up with her, slighly winded. She must have been walking faster than she realized.

"Why are you leaving so soon? There is still another vingnette and you'll miss the incredible magician that is touring with them now. A personal connection that I made on behalf of the troupe."

The Queen studied Lord Burrington for a moment. He looked as if everything they had just seen was simple, innocent fun. He wore a stupid look of comedic enjoyment on his face. She hated him even more in that moment, than she had before. "I think you know very well why I am leaving."

"Because of that?" he pointed back towards the theater. "That's...that's comedy, satire. That is their role and purpose to lampoon those in power."

"Is the second sketch about you? You have power."

"Perhaps, but not like the monarch. Besides, can I really be faulted if you saw too much of yourself in that scene? That was not the intention. It was mere commentary on the role of a monarch."

"Monsters who steal and beat their subjects?"

"Now I wouldn't put it that way, but can you deny that the monarchy is premised on the notion of seizing and maintained that which is not its own."

"I would deny this. The monarchy is the thread that stitches dispirate lands into a place, into a realm, into a people."

"And what if the people do not see it this way?"

"Lord Burrington, I do not appreciate being lectured on the ways of the common people by someone like yourself. Your family is powerful and wealthy. Perhaps even more so than mine."

"Perhaps. True, true, but with one crucial difference."

"And that difference is that?"

"A crown has never touched the head of anyone in my family."

"And that privilege seems to have made me a mark for humilitation this way."

"No, your majesty. Please, I meant no offense, I thought you would find the humor in it. Certainly other did."

"I must not be in the mood for humor after all. Good day." She continued her brisk paced walk back to the edge of the park. She wondered how far and for how long Lord Burrington would follow her.

He was more persistent that she thought he would be. He finally caught up with her again and said, "Please, your majesty, do not run off like this. I would very much like to introduce you to the artist I mentioned earlier. I think you will find his work most intruiging and well worth your time."

"More so than your travelling band of cut-throats?"

"Yes, more than that, I promise."

***

The Queen declined to take a carriage to the artist's studio, wanting to walk off her frustration and hide her verxation with Lord Burrington. She kept her brisk stride and he managed to keep up with her. 

As they walked, he tried to sell her on the artist they were about to visit, "Now I must admit that his works may not suit your taste, but I think if it sit with the images and the technique you'll find something very unique that's being offered. I think it is the technique that stands out the most. This artist uses very bold brushwork and layers colors in a most unusual, inventive way. I felt truly lucky when I happened upon this work."

"And how did you discover this hidden prodigy?" the Queen asked, not trying to be overly provacative, but unable to let some of her frustration slip into her word choice.

"Well, it just so happens that our lovely candidate for the observer has an older brother. I discovered them as a pair, as it were. I marvelled that a family could produce two offspring with such unique sparks of creativity and inginuity."

"I did not realize that the observer was creative or ingenous. What is her particular talent?"

"Well she didn't have a specific craft, but as young as she was I'm sure she could have been cultivated into a fine talent. Call it a patron's intuition."

"I see, and her brother, this artist is looking for a patron."

"Yes, and I believe his work interest you greatly."

They arrived at a section of the town that had once beeen horse stables. Once those moved to the outer edge of the city, the stables were converted into workshops for craftsmen and artists. They walked up a narrow flight of stairs and entered the artist's studio.

In the late afternoon sun, the studio seemed cramped and small. The earthy smell of pigments hit her nose when they walked in. The Queen scanned the room at that various paintins and drawings that here hanging pell-mell on the wall and from the rafters. The artist was working on a large canvas propped against the far wall. He must had stopped in the middle of a brush stroke, because he stood there in front of the painting, tapping his foot impatiently. Then in a flurry he applied several dense layers of paint in the area he was working on.

"We have arrived, and I have a special vistor," Lord Burrington said. 

The artist turned and looked his visitors up and down. "I didn't realize that my door was open to visitors."

"No, well I have brought you a very special visitor."

"One worth interrupting my work over."

"I should say so."

"And does this visitor have a name?"

Lord Burrington looked at her and simply said, "She has requested anonmyity until we reach an understanding. Should she become a patron, all will be come clear."

The artist huffed and turned back to his work, "Very well, show her around like you have shown aroudn the others. Please keep your interruptions to a minimum." She was not sure if she should be offended by the artists impudence or take pleasure in his clear disdain for Lord Burrington. Now that she had met this scurrulous person there was a chance she might actualy patronize him.  

They went around the small space looking at the artists work. It was, indeed, inventive and unusual, but also something about the technique repelled her. Many of the canvases were smothered in dark hues, as if they had been doused in fire. Smears of dark earthtones seemed to erupt out of the voids that suffocated the margins of the paintings. There was something suffocating and oppressive about them.

She studied the imagery better. Human forms were contorted, like a buckets of limbs and skin that someone had thrown together. Many of the figures cried out in agony, faces lifted to the sky, not out of hope, but more like looking for an escape. Figures seemed to pile on each other, tearing at one another. Cities were on fire, villages burned. The few flashes of bright color looked like the glint of sun off of armor and weapons.

Lord Burrington leaned in and whispered, "Remarkable work, don't you think. I find it captures something I didn't even realized needed to be captured."

"It is remarkable, but agonizing as well. Do you relish that feeling, Lord Burrington."

"Relish no, but it speaks to something...true in me."

"I did not realize you were such a devoted seeker of truth."

"It may not be my natural state, but work like this calls me to it."

"I see, may I speak with the artist."

"Certainly, of course."

She walked up beside the artist, who did, in fact stop his painting, as if realizing who she was now that she was up close. He did not seemed concered about hosting the queen in his studio or the possibility of her becoming his patron. "I would like to ask you about your work."

"Yes, what about it?"

"I am curious where you draw inspiration for your images. Do you paint the world as you see it?"

"I am a visionary, not a recorder. I do not have a cloak hanging up in my closet. I leave that to my little sister."

"I see, and what are these visions you see."

"The future. I paint what will be."

"And all of this," the Queen said gesturing to the paintings. "All of this is what will be?"

"I believe so, yes. This is the future as I have seen it. Does it disturb you or offend you in some way?"

"Surprises me. And I hope, sincereley hope that you are wrong."

"We shall see. In the mean time, I must finish working on this section of my painting before the light gives out and goes away."

Lord Burrington stepped in to say, "Then we will take our leave. And I will be in touch. Let my people know if you need anything."

"I have let them know that I have no wine to drink, and no one will bring me wine."

The Queen replied, "I will have something sent to you from my personal cellar, if that is agreeable."

The artist bowed low, perhaps in mockery, though perhaps in genuine apprecatation, "Then I must count you as one of the true patrons of the arts."

***

Before returning home, Lord Burrington steered them towards a small sidewalk cafe that served strong coffee. The Queen welcomed the moment to rest and refresh herself, though she was growing tired of Lord Burrington's company. Now that they had visited the artist, he spoke mostly about his various connections and acquantainces, of lavish parties and society gossip. She listened in a state of detatched curiousity, but realized that she was not going to be able to gather much useful intelligence from him. 

The waiter did a double take when he returned with their coffees and placed one in front of the Queen. She still wore her veiled hat so she was not completley conspicuous. The waiter seemed to think that the idea that he was serving the queen was too ludicrous to be real and shook and his and returned his duties.

As they sipped their coffees, Lord Burrington broached the subject of the artist, "So, are you interesting in patronizing this talent?"

"I agree that he is talented, and very unusual in all of the ways you point out. He does seem to have a number of peculiarities."

"Such as."

"He seem to be very contemptuous of his position as artist needing patrons. I feel he would be more content to somehow paint and not worry abotu the concerns of daily life at all."

"Perhaps so, and perhaps true of many artist, but they live in our world and our world demands that artists have patrons."

"But to what end?"

"To reach a larger audience, to affect people, to do the things that art is intended to do."

"Yes, I grant you that. I wonder how it look were to Crown to patronize an artist like this."

"Like what exactly?"

"So obsessed with dissolution and destruction. It doesn't portray a very positive view of the future."

"I don't see it that way at all. Perhaps people, people who pay attention to such things, will see it as a sign."

"A sign of what"

"A sign that the Queen is paying attention."

"Yes, but paying attention to what, I feel you are speaking in circles. In any case, I am, in fact, interested in patronizing this young artist, but I feel that I must do so on a personal basis, not as an act of the Crown."

Lord Burrington looked at her shrewdly, "Interesting. Is this a difference without a distinction?"

"Not for me, not at this point. It would give me personal pleasure to support him, but the monarch is indifferent to his work."

"Fascinating, I have never heard you speak of yourself in such terms before."

"Perhaps I have never had an occasion to do so before now..." From the outside, someone might have interpreted this banter as flirtation between two seemingly well-off individuals, puttin their fliration on display for all to see. Little would they know that these two people were really poking and proding each other, testing each other to see how the other might react to this phrase or this gesture. They were testing each others limits and capacities.

It was clear to her that Lord Burrington had not inteded this afternoon to be a mere frivolous distraction. She felt strongly that his choices were meant to communicate something to her.

Before she could settle on that this something might be, a small company of soldiers appeared around them on the street. The captain of the guard stepped in the space they left. He saluted the Queen and nodded to Lord Burrington, "Your majesty, you are wanted back at your house. There is an urgent matter that requires your attention."

The Queen stood up, noticing the stares of the everyone in the cafe, on the street, and in the shop doorways, staring at her. Two shoulders gathered her up and whisked her away, down the street and into a carriage. They sped off down the street, which had been emptied of other traffic moments before they arrived, and completely unbeknowst to her.

# Chapter 9: True to Life #

The captain of the guard looked grave and determined. He started out of the carriages windows, alternating between both sides. The Queen was finally able to get his attention and asked the first question that came to mind, "How did you find me?"

"One of our spymaster's spies saw you leaving the house earlier in a clandestine fashion and tailed you."

"I was followed that whole time and didn't realize it."

"Yes, your majesty. I apologize for the deception, but they spy was nto sure of the proper etiquette."

"Well, I am relieved that our spies are committed to such good manners. In the future I would prefer to know when I had secre agents of the Crown secretly following me, the crown's wearer."

"Yes, your majesty. I apologize."

"No apology necessary, I'm sure the spy was doing what he thought was right."

"She, your majesty."

"What's that?"

"The spy was a woman, a she not a he."

"Of course." They road along for several more minutes in silence. The Queen could tell the captain wanted to say something but was hesitating. "Captain, I feel you have something else to say to me. Please share it."

"Your majesty, your actions today..."

"Were rash and showed poor judgment. I put myself and the monarchy in danger. Who knows what could have happened. Do not worry, Captain, I have already lectured myself sufficiently. I had a strong motivation to take the actions I did."

"May I ask if it had something to do with Lord Burrington."

"I don't care to share the details of my personal life, Captain. You know that."

"I did not mean to imply. But, pardon me for saying, I don't think you spent the afternoon with Lord Burrington for personal reasons."

"That is very speculative, Captain." She smiled and added, "But also perceptive. Tell me, do you think I can trust Lord Burrington?"

"It is not proper for me to speculate about the lord's conduct."

"No, it's quite alright, I am asking. No, I am ordering you to share your opinion."

"If I were to speak freely, then I would say, no, you cannot trust him. I believe that Lord Burrington's actions are guided by one principal interest."

"And that would be?"

"Lord Burrington, my lady."

***

The Queen's guards whisked her into her private study. When she entered the room, she was surprised to see the archvist there, pacing the room. When he heard the door open, he turned suddenly, but didn't seem to notice right away that she was there. He seemed to be a world away until he realized she was there, "Your majesty, there has been a terrible tragedy."

"Is it your father? Is he okay?"

"He was no worse when he left, but that is not the tragedy. It's the archive, your majesty. It's been overtaken"

"Overtaken, by who?"

"I can't say for sure. I barely escaped the soldiers who were occupying the tower. But there were priests among the soldiers, your majesty. And one priest seemed to be leading them, a young priest."

"Could it have been the High Priest?" she asked. 

"Perhaps, again, it was very chaotic. I can't say for sure. There is something else. I could be wrong, but I thought I caught a glimpse of a figure wearing the cloak moving through the scene, recording what was taking place."

"But why would the priests want to seize the archive and record it in this way? Has something like this ever happened?"

"I don't know. There have historically been tensions between the priests and the archvisits, of course. At one point in time, there was a record of a duel taking place, but it is unclear if such a thing ever came to pass."

"And what of your father and brother?"

"They have fled and are on their way here your majesty. I fear the kingdom is at ill at ease though. As I journyed here, people eyed me with sucpicion, even fear. I am not a seasoned traveler, but I cannot remember a time when you could not travel freely through the kingdom."

"Yes, it seems there is a plot afoot, I just don't know how it will play out. I must think about this and meet with my advisors. Can you be available for provide witness?"

"Of course, but your majesty there is one more thing you should know."

"What is that?"

"The scroll that I shared with you when you visited the archive, that details how your ancestors came to power and how they used the observer."

"Yes."

"It is no longer in my posession, your majesty. I was unable to secure it before I left."

"So the High Priest may have that document in his hands."

"Yes."

"Then that must figure into the plan somehow."

The meeting the Queen wished to hold never happened. The senior advisor could not be located and there were whispers that he had fled the city and disappeared. Before they could start, for the second time today, guards burst into the council chamber along with her captain, "We must leave the city now," he said, his face full of alarm, perhaps even fear.

The guards led the Queen through the narrow obscure paths the servants took, much like the one she used to sneak out of the house earlier. As they walked, the captain explained, "An army was spotted in encampment two days ride from the city. Our rider was nearly captured and suffered a mortal injury. He made it here to spread the news before he died."

"That is tragic. Please be sure that his family is compensated."

"We will do our best, your highness, unfortunately, he died very much in the public's view. Word is spreading now and I fear a general mood of panic has seized the city. People are beginning to evacuate or retreat to the old part of the city."

"And you believe this threat, believe that this army is making its way here?"

"I do, your majesty. Other stories have started to emerge of soldiers movements, whispers that suddenly make a clear picture of what has been happeneing."

"Are there priests with the soldiers?"

"I cannot say at this time."

"I must know. Please find out."

"Yes, your majesty"

They finally made their way outside where there were two carriages waiting. A woman was dressed in one of her older dresses, but bore a strikign resemblance to herself. The captain explained, "Your spy, my lady. She will be a body double." The spy who had tailed the Queen earlier curtseyed to the Queen. The captain continued, "Each carriage will take a different route. Only myself and the driver know the routes. I have selected these men personally and trust them."

"And the final destination."

"We plan to evacuate you to your father's estate. It is remote and puts more distance between yourself and the army."

"Very well, let's not waste more time then."

***

For two days, a small company of soliders on horseback, along with the captain, rode alongside the carriage. They took little known rodes, sometimes little more than deerpaths through forests and fields. They stayed away from villages and camped in areas that would not be seen from any roads or paths.

The Queen experienced a strange mixture of boredom and anxiety as they traveled. Every distant shout, a whinny of a horse, or a wayward sound of a bird overhread sent her into a panic. At the same time, shetook no interest in the landscape or country side, besides she had been coudl not look outside the carriage since the window had been curtained then boarded up to protect her.

She sat in near total darkness for several days waiting, wainting for news, waiting to arrive. Most of all, she waited for the endgame of whatever machinations were being played out in the kingdom. She almost couldn't believe that mere days ago, she was walking in the park on a pleasant afternoon with Lord Burrington, while her kingdom was possibly in the midst of being overthrown by none other than Lord Burrington and the High Priest.

She tried to image what they would do with the kingdom, what their ultimate aim was, but she could think of nothing. Was the High Priest's personal dislike of her enough to motivate him to bring her reign to an end? Perhaps so. He seemed very changed when she met him last at the citadel. Perhaps this was all Lord Burrington's doing, perhaps the High Priest was just a plaything in this game. She had no way of knowing sitting in her dark carriage.

Two days into the journey to her father's estate, their carriage was overtaken by a messengar on horseback. The carriage and the handful of guards stopped to receive the messengar. The Queen sat in silence in the carriage, looking straight ahead. Finally, there was a knock at the carriage door and the captain appeared. "What is the news?" the Queen asked.

"The city has been overrun, my lady."

"And the casualties?"

"Unclear at this time, though the messengar reported seeing plumes of smoke as he rode away from the city."

"They're setting fire to the city?"

"Perhaps, your majesty. Or it could be accidental. We cannot say now."

"Very well, at least this amounts to a declaration of war. There is nothing to do now but to carry on."

The traveled for another day before the reached the edge of the estate. When they finally stopped outside the great house, the Queen was surpised by how wild and overgrown everything looked. The house itself was in disrepair. The once warm and inviting, though imposing house, seemed lifeless and cold now.

Inside, what furniture was left was still covered. Everything was dusty. The Queen ran her finger along the top of the long table in the entryway and left a finger wide track in the dust. She looked around to see if there were any staff working in the house. A small ragged crew entered the entry way to greet her. 

She nodded and greeted each one of them before retiring upstairs. As she walked with the captain of the guard, she commented, "That is a small group of servants for the house."

"I apologize your majesty. These were the only people we could find that were still being retained to work in the house should we return."

"And the others?"

"Most refused since they had not been compensated by the crown in years."

"We stopped paying them?"

"It appears that way. This may be a temporary waypoint anyway."

"I would like th discuss strategy as soon as possible."

The captain stopped in the hall, "Strategy, my lady? Strategy for what?"

"For conducting the war? I would like to know when I can expect the generals to arrive to discuss our next move."

"I regret to say this, but there won't be a next move."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean to say that I don't think we can rely on there being an army to fight in your name anymore. The army was barebones enough as it is. This rebellion may have been the final snap to break it."

"But this is speculation on your part, you don't know for a fact?"

"That is true. I hope to have more information soon, but from the hints that the messengar dropped, I believe this to be the case."

"So what do we do then?"

"We wait until we cannot wait any longer and then we run."

"And after that?"

"We continue to run until we can secure your safety."

"And if that cannot be done?"

"Then you will no longer require my services because I will most likely be dead. After that, I cannot say."

The Queen continued to her room in silence. When she stepped into her old room, she went to the bed and flung herself down on it, much like she would have done when she was younger and fed up with some stricture being delieved to her by her mother. Dust floated up from the covers and glittered in dim light that came in the dirty windows.

She rolled on her back and an unexpected through floated through her mind. "I want to see Avalon. I wish Avalon was here."

***

The next morning she was served a cold breakfast. The old woman who brough it up to her room had trembling hands and made the the dishes and silverware clink as she walked. "I apologize for the cold breakfast, my lady, we were instructed that we could not light a fire for fear of detection."

"That is quite alright. Thank you."

Before she left the room, the old woman stopped at the door and said, "Beg your pardon, your majesty. May I speak my mind freely?"

The queen turned away from her simple breakfast and replied, "Yes, please do."

"I served your father for many years. I was a loyal servant."

"I thank you for your service."

"But we haven't been treated well in the recent times and it is a crying shame."

"I didn't realize. I am truly sorry for that."

"Whether you knew or not, my lady, it was done in your name. And it's a pity it happened that way."

"I agree. I hope we can fix this somehow."

"Perhaps we might. Thank you, my lady. I feel much better now."

The servant took her leave and the Queen ate her breakfast. She went downstairs to the library where her father often worked and waited for news. The captain was supposed to meet with her at midday to update her on any information he had collected. They needed to determine their next steps, since determining a strategy was out of the question.

The captain was late, leaving the Queen to sit in the library and peruse the books there. She had brough many of the volumes, like the ones that Lord Burrington had perused in her parlor not that long agao, that had sentimental value to her to her home, her former home, in the city. Most of what was left here were treatises about plants and flowers, books of legal theory, and other topics that griped her father's interest from time to time.

As far as she knew, he had built up this library on his own, maybe built off of a few inherited volumes. But sitting here was like sitting inside a map of his mind. As she flipped through the dense esoteric language that many of them contained, she realized that she had no more access to the mind here than she did when the man was alive.

She wondered if it was true that her father was detached. He could be warm and inviting when he wanted. He was not frivolous, but could be jolly, even fun at times. But he did retire from the world, in a sense, or demanded that the world meet him on his terms rather than the other way around. Perhaps she had a streak of this as well. 

The captain finally arrived for their meeting, his boots and cape splattered with wet and mud. He stopped short of the old worn rug in the middle of the library. "I have just returned from a long morning's ride and have news to share with you."

"Any of it good?"

"No, I am afraid not. In fact, I fear that the first piece of news is tragic. The spy who dressed as your double was overtaken by soliders and killed a day into her journey. All of the soldiers traveling with her were killed as well, all but one who seemed to have left the party early."

"Were they betrayed somehow?"

"That is my fear. Which means we can trust no one. I recomend that we dismiss the house staff. It was a mistake bringin them on."

"Do you really think that is necessary? I spoke with one this morning and she seemd very pleasant."

"Your majesty, these are dire times and we must assume the worse. May I dismiss the staff?"

"Very well, I'm not sure how this will help, since they already know we are here, but I approve."

"Good, I will inform them immediately. In the meantime, I think we should stay here tonight then prepare to leave in the morning."

"That is fine with me. Where will we go?"

"I would prefer to keep your next desintation a secret for now, we cannot know for sure if someone is watching or listenting or not."

"Captain, surely you cannot belive this?"

"I must believe anything in the name of performing my sworn duty to keep you safe." The captain bowed and left the room. 

A few moments later, the Queen heard a commotion outside. She went to the window as saw that the captain had lined up the handful of staff on the lawn. They were confused and scared and plading with the captain. The old woman she had spoken with earlier was trembling and looking frightened for her life.

The Queen assumed they were just confused by the sudden change in their circumstances and would go about their business. She started to turn away from the window but heard a loud scream. She looked again and saw that the captain and another soldier had cut down the staff with thier swords. The old bodies lay in a bloody heap on the grass. 

In shock, she backed away from the window, nearly stumbling over a chair that lay in her way. She caught herself but crumpled to the floor. Her vision went out of focus as she repeated to herself over and over, "How did it come to this?"

***

The Queen did not leave her room until the next morning. She could hear the captain pacing outside her door, anxioulsy awaiting for her. They were due to leave soon for the undisclosed location.

As she readied herself, she wondered if she could trust the Captain. He had never given her any reason not to trust him until yesterday. Killing the servants seemed excessive and unnecessary to her. Was her life really worth this, particularly if her reign was coming to an end either way? She determined that her demise would not be accompanied by a trail of dead bodies.

She nearly ran into the Captain as she left her room, lost in thought about how best to address what happened yesterday. Before she could broach the subject though, they heard distant shouting from outside and a screeching sound like an alarm. The Captain grabbed her by the wrist and began dashing down the hall, "We must leave. The advanced guards have spotted a threat."

"So they've found us."

"I'm afraid so."

She stopped sharply and wrenched her wrist free. "How am I to trust you then?"

"Your majesty? I don't understand."

"The double was found out. I saw you kill those servants yesterday. A mere half day later and we've been found out. What else should think?"

"You think that I have betrayed you?"

"I am beginning to suspect."

"I would never..." but his words were cut short by more shouting, this closer. A crashing sound of the door, clashing swords. A thud of a body. 

The captain drew his sword. Will he strike me down here and now? the queen thought, frantically trying to decide how best to defend herself. The captain lunged forward, but gave her a push. "Go, go now. I will meet the threat. Alone you should be able to escape."

She turned and ran as fast as she could. She remebered that there was a hidden passage nearby, she could play there as a little girl, until her mother panicked when she could not be found and told her, "It is not proper for princesses to hide like a thief in her own house."

This passage emerged into a room that had once been a convalensce room when her mother took ill later in her life. Everything was draped in ghostly coverings. She nearly sneezed from the dust but held it back for fear of being discovered. When her mother was ill, a balcony and steps down to the garden had been added so that she could take fresh air and walk without coming into contact with others in the household.

She opened the door and raced down the stairs, fleeing into the maze of shrubs and walls that made up the gardens closets to the house. She heard more cries raised, but these were cries of soldeirs communicatign to each other. They were looking for her. She heard branches and plants crumble under heave feet and knew she needed somewhere to hide. 

From the corner of her eye, she caught sight of the old greenhouse and dashed towards it. Many of the panes of glass were cracked and broken. Dirty light seeped in through the dirty panes. She rushed past rows and rows of dead plants, broken pots. Everything was crumpled up and decayed.

She hid away in a dark corner of the green house, behind a row of large pots that had once held exotic trees that her father imported from far away. As she crouched there, she remembered that the trees were small but bore small bittersweet fruit. She would screw up her nose as a child, but insist on eating more even when her father warned her that it might make her sick.

Soldiers were inside the greenhouse now, knocking and crashing their way through it, looking for her. She tried to squeeze back as far as she could into the dark, but a soldier finally peered down and shouted out, "She's over here. I've found her." Quickly another soldier was by his side. They reached in to grab her as if reaching for a caged, cornered animal. She started to twist and kick, more out of instinct than any clear idea that she could get away and flee.

Together the soldiers finally got a firm enough grasp on her to drag her out from her hiding place. Her head bumped against one of the large pots as they did so. They let her legs drop on the dirty ground, then gripped her under her arms and hoisted her up. She still fought against them, but they were able to drag her out of the greenhouse without much exertion.

"Where are you taking me?" she cried out, but they wouldn't answer her. The looked ahead, grimly doing their duty, whatever their duty might be.

Apparently it was to take her into the orchard. They dragged her flailing form past the dead and twisted trees in the orchard to the center point where the rocks stood, where she had found the boy, Leif sick and miserable after the High Priest punished him.

He was there, the High Priest, rather the boy who was a man know who became the High Priest. Now he wasn't sick and supine and moaning in despair. He stood confidently, arms crossed, in front of the rock wall. He had been waiting for her, waiting for her in this symbolic place, which spoke to his confidence that she would be found and that a confrontation would happen here.

The soldiers dropped her to the ground. Her head fell forward and stayed that way, just as she stayed on her hands and knees in the overgrown grass. The High Priest instructed the soliders to leave them and they disappeared into the orchard somewhere.

"You should stand up, your highness. There is no reason to prostrate yourself before me. Those days are over."

She wanted to resist being commanded this way, but she felt an urge to confront him head on, to look him in the eyes. If she was going to be executed, he wanted him to have to see her, confront her as she was, not just a concept or idea.

She slowly rose up, brushed herself off and stared at him.

"That is better now. You are more like a shadow of former self than a cracked image. I prefer it this way, actually. There is no need for dramatics." He paused and looked around him, "The apple trees are dead. That's good. I can still taste them to this day."

"Is that what this is about? A little boy who was punished with apples?"

The High Priest shook his head, "No...but in a sense yes, but not in the way you mean."

"Why here? Why are we standing here of all places?"

"Does it surprise you?"

"You said when I spoke to you at the citadel that you did not like to dwell on these days."

"That is true, and yet I have thought about that day almost every day since." He started to pace around the weedy clearing, "This grass, those trees, these rocks. The sun, the air. It's not perfect, today. This isn't exactly like it was. But this...this is very close."

"Leif, this is madness. Armies marching, burning towns, terrorizing people. How did this start? Why are you doing this?"

"How did this start? Now, that, my lady, is an interesting question." He produced a scroll from inside the long cut jacket he wore instead of robes. He held it up and must have seen a flash of recnogition in her eyes. "I can see that you know what this is. Have you read it?" She shook her head affirmately. "Then you know that what is happening didn't start with me. It started with you. With your people and their lust for power. What I am doing is putting an end to this, rewriting the story, divering the plot in a new direction."

"This feels like some kind of punishment."

"Good, it should. That is the intention."

"But what have I done?"

"Done, didn't do. It doesn't matter. Can't you understand that this is bigger you and me? Bigger than that fool Lord Burrington. I am wresting this," he shook the scroll, "out of your hands and starting anew."

"Putting the priesthood in charge, ruling from behind the heavy walls of the citadel. How will that be any better? And the houses? How will you appease and control the lords. Your new story won't look that different. Even now, the soliders you've sent out are fighting like soldiers always have."

"If we were in a debating society, these would all be interesting points. But I have seen how the monarchy has used people, warped people for its own selfish ends, then cast them aside. And no, I'm not just talking about that day so long ago when a young boy was forced to witness things that terrified me until I was old enough to master that fear. I mastered it by shaping it into anger then a determination to bring it all to an end."

"Even if it means destroying everything in your path."

"Maybe. Perhaps. That is not yet written in the scrolls. The precious archive can tell us knothign about that. So, it remains to be seen what will happen."

"Will this be the place? Where I meet my end?"

"That is the plan. That is my intention." He closed his eyes and breathed deeply as if savoring all the sensations of a memory. "This moment has been in my thoughts for a very, very long time."

Just as he opened his eyes, the captain of the guard came crashing into the clearing, bloodied but wielding an even bloodier sword. He raised an furious cry and charged at the High Priest. The High Priest easily dodged the wounded captain, and seen enough more soldiers were entering the fray. 

The Queen saw her chance and in the confusion, slipped away and started running faster than she had ever run in her life.

# Chapter 10: Tara #

The Queen, who wasn't a queen anymore wandered for days after escaping the soliders and the High Priest. Through some combination of luck or careful hiding, she was able to elude the search parties that were sent out looking for her. 

After several days, it seemed like the concerted efforts to find her had stopped. She assumed that at this point, the soldiers would be dispatched to small villages and hamlets that dotted the countryside around the estate. 

She didn't know this land well, but a few recognizable features in the land suggested to her that she was heading towards the coastline, just as she had so many years ago when Avalon was sent away. She had repeated that journey several more times before she finally chose her own observer.

By now she was feeling weak and tired. She sipped water when she crossed a muddy stream, or found rainwater accumulated in a plant. She lived off of mushrooms and birds eggs that she could find. The nights were getting colder to, so found herself huddling in piles of leaves for warmth.
