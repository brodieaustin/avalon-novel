# Chapter 1 #

"Avalon!" Tara called out from her threshold between her bedroom and the upstairs hall. "Avalon!" But the footsteps that grew louder up the stairs were not Avalon's at all. They lacked the purposeful, elegeant glide that Avalon's unmistakable footsteps had. These footsteps were purposeful, for sure, but each thud announced a walker stepping with forced purpose, almost willing each step to land, one after the other.

Tara retreated back into her bedroom, slamming the door behind her. As if defying her will, the door opened again, just ajar at first, and the maid appeared there in the gap. Tara, facing the window, called out peevishly, "You're not Avalon"

"No young miss, I'm not. But I was told by Ms. Reedy to ready you for her arrival."

Tara wanted to fling herself onto the bed, to roll up in the blankets and wail and cry for Avalon until she arrived. She wanted to do something with the bundle of energy that rose up and knocked about her inside. In the past she would have let that energy knock about the room, maybe even knock into the maid. 

This very thing happened not long ago, and the maid, younger than this one, but seemingly always frail with a retiring manner, was knocked on her back and suffered a mere bump, Tara felt). The maid left their service, forcing Ms. Reedy to search yet again for a maid. Only this time, she had issued a warning to Tara. Ms. Reedy would bring this behavior to her father's attention. This surely would jeopardize her thirteenth year trip. The impatience she felt waiting for Avalon to return paled in comparison to the blistering agitation of waiting for hours and days and weeks to pass for this trip.

She simply had to control her self. So, she channeled Avalon who always seemed serene, peaceful, sometimes far away. Whereas Tara often felt herself bursting through life, Avalon seemed to float and glide. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that Tara liked Avalon being back in the household, even if these stays were inevitably too short. 

So Tara tried to imagine herself as Avalon. She stood still there in the middle of her spacious though modest room, eyes blurring out the rolling hills and trees and surrounded the house. As her feeling waned, she shut the blur out and turned to the maid. 

The door opened now and the maid filled the door's frame. This maid was more advanced in years than the previous ones. Ms. Reedy lamented that it was harder and harder to recruit good help from the capital, the capital being so far away. No wanted to venture out into the peripheray to work. Tara couldn't help but wonder if Ms. Reedy's lament was as much about herself as it was about cooks and scullery maids.

Their cottage had always been far away to Tara's recollection. When she was little and romped through the woods, this suited her just fine. Life sometimes just felt like it was her and her father. Now that she was older, and having beeing exposed to Ms. Reedy's influence for well over three years now, but she found herself coming around to Ms. Reedy's point of view. She implicity understood that the good things they lacked could be found in the capital and the bad things they had could be attributed to "this house" and "this place."

"Fine, you may proceed." Tara's finally said, resigned to the mundane things that the day held in store for her. The maid proceeded into her room and began doing those mundane things--laying out clothes, picking up others, straigthening the bed. Tidying, arranging, and moving about the room in haste.

Once the final button was buttoned, Tara sat down at the small dressing table in her room. It was one that she had had since a little girl, but still served it's purpose and so had not been replaced by a more adult version. The maid began brushing out Tara's long, thick, dark hair.

"You have lovely hair." Tara sat silently and didn't respond. "My daughter had long hair like yours. More honey color though. Yours is dark like a forest."

Tara, continuing in the theme of trying to make nice with the maid and stay in her mother's good graces, replied casually, "I didn't realize you had a daughter."

The maid stood silently for a moment, continuing to brush, as if deciding whether to elaborate further, "Yes, she was one of six. My favorite though. She was an imaginative one."

Tara's own imagination could not resist this hook and asked in a casual way, not wanting to seem overly interested in her maid's life, "What happened to her?"

Another voice cut into the room before the maid could respond, "I'm sure this is not the proper time and place for that," Ms. Reedy said, sweeping into the room with authority and assurance. The maid stepped back and curtseyed, "Ma'am."

"You may leave and continue your duties elsewhere, Frannie."

"Yes, Ms Reedy. Good day young miss," the maid replied before leaving the room.

With the door closed, Ms. Reedy stood behind her. "While I'm happy to see you getting along better with the help, Tara, you do not need to engage them in salacious conversation?"

"Salacious?"

"Frannie isn't a scandal sheet dear. I've already had to speak to her about telling tales to the kitchen help. I won't have your father's house full of talk such as that."

Tara was not entirely sure what "talk like that" might be, but she had future plans to protect and preserve and decided to not risk those by probing this evasive speech any further. She filed away this vague rule in her mind and decided that it would be best to carry out the letter and spirt of the law.

"But that is not why I came up to your room."

"No?"

"No, dear. I came to tell you that your father has granted us special permission to travel to town to purchase a new dress for you before the trip."

Tara leapt to her feet, overcome with excitement. "Really? That is wonderful." She paused, "Will it be ready in time?"

"I'm sure the local dressmaker can be convinced to work with haste for the Chief Recorder's daughter."

"Oh I hope so."

"We will leave after lunch. And after you have completed your morning studies."

Tara's excitement began to dissipate, "After lunch, but what about AValon?"

"What about Avalon?"

"What if I miss her?"

"Miss her, Tara, you must stop this silly obsessino with Avalon. It has gone on long enough. You are soon to be thirteen. Soon it will be time to declutter your mind of girlish things."

Tara shrank back from her own thoughts, feeling embarassed and ashamed of being called childish. "Yes, ma'am," was her meek reply.

"Well, then please come down to breakfast and let us start this day."

Ms. Reedy left her alone in her room to brood over her conflicting feelings. She went closer to the window and watched as the old gardener who tended what little grounds their remote cottage had. She watched as he slowly placed a ladder at a hedgerow that needed trimming. He turned back and walked with a shuffling pace to retrive the clippers that were resting against a wagon. He set the clippers by the ladder and took another trip to retrieve something else.

Watching him filled her with impatience. Why didn't he just push the cart forward and have his tools ready to use? She couldn't imagine herself plodding between these little points getting one little thing then another.

Life in the cottage had always felt remote and isolated, until Avalon returned from an expedition, swept into their lives. She swept into Tara's life, in particular, full of stories and observations about the world out there, a world that Tara hardly knew first hand.

She would know soon enough, though. She had dreamed of her first trip to the capital with her father for nearly a year now, and it was soon to happen. Then life would crack open and come spilling out. She longed to chase after it in one rush, not gingerly stepping and clipping at bit after bit like that gardener. Her life was meant for more. She would make sure it was meant for more.

***

Breakfast proceeded as it alwasy did. Her father sat absorbed in whatever reading material he had before him, vacantly forking food into his mouth, sipping from his tea cup. He finally finished, smiled and the table, and retired to his study.

Tara barely whispered a "Good day, papa," knowing that he likely wouldn't hear it anway.

Meanwhile, Ms. Reedy kept up her morning's dialog with little corrective suggestions. Their meals, particularly in the last few months, were punctuated with "Lift your chin...keep your back rigid...No, not that fork...Slurping is for the common worker..." and so on. Tara had become so used to digesting these tidbits of advice that it seems like yet mere garnish for the simple meals they ate, prepared to her father's tastes.

With breakfast done and cleared, they went to the parlor for Tara's morning lessons. Ms. Reedy focused more on the "refined" arts like languages and music. They did some drawing, though Ms. Reedy felt that Tara's drawings hewed too closely to "life as it is, not life as it should be." She would continue on in this vein, explaining "Art is best suited for elevating the mind and tastes of its viewer and listener. It should remind us that there are worlds unseen, not stay steeped in what is around us. There is no greater threat to the creative spirit than the mundane."

Tara dutifully absorbed these maxims from Ms. Reedy, knowing that they, like so much else that Ms. Reedy taught here, were all meant to prepare her for her first taste of life in the capital, for her trip, for the world at large.

Lessons went slowly today. Ms. Reedy had to continually remind Tara to focus on her studies. Tara found herself jolting to attention at any sound like might signify Avalon's return. But none of the creaks or pops or bangs that distracted here were Avalon. The promise of seeing Avalon sooner rather than later was not to be. 

Lunch time was approaching, which meant ending lessons on etiquette. Ms. Reedy began to discourse on her chosen topic today--the processional order when entering a ballroom. She seems reinvigorated as she described how to determine who in a room to give way to when the dancing was announced, and who to not defer to in the process. "Never give way to someone of a lower status. You will be announcing to the world that you have no place, or that your place is not worth asserting in the room." 

"Yes, Ms. Reedy," Tara replied. Ms. Reedy's eyes were animated by memories she must have been reliving of some scenes from her past. Tara knew that Ms. Reedy came from a prominent family. Her father had been in the Queen's entourage at court, or something like that. The result being that Ms. Reedy learned about and been exposed to many of the things that Tara was learning about and would be exposed to too.

As the lesson came to a close, Tara heard the door open and shut. Without thinking, she leapt to her feet and into the hallway to see who had enetered. "Oh, Father, it's you..."

"Tara, aren't you supposed to be attending to your studies?"

Ms. Reedy stood at the doorway now, "We were just finishing up. I'm afraid that Tara is on pins and needles today."

Her father stood staring at them both, not replying. As if finally registering the meaning of Ms. Reedy's words, "Hmm, pins and needles..."

"On account of your generous offer of a new dress."

This did little to clear her father's puzzlement, but he replied automatically, treating the conversation more like a series of scripted actions than a genuine dialog. Tara cut into the dialog, "And Avalon, father. She was suppsoed to be back by now."

"Avalon returns when Avalon returns. She has important business to attend to. You know that, Tara. I'm afraid that I must be gettign back to my work. Just took a constitutional walk to clear my mind. Please do not let me hear you ask about Avalon again, Tara. It is becoming a distraction."

Ms. Reedy interjected, "I will be sure she maintains the proper perspective adn outlook on this matter of Avalon." Before her father could leave them, she added, "Lunch will be ready shortly."

"Oh, no...no, no... I will not be at lunch today, I'm afraid. There's simply too much to be done. Simply too much." His voice trailed off as he disappeared into the house.

In the midst of their lunch, Ms. Reedy delicately wiped the corners of her mouth and said, "I was waiting to share this you and now seems like an appropraite time. I received a letter from my neice the other day."

"The younger one, who lives in the capital?" Tara, who has not interested at first in what Ms. Reedy had to share with her, snapped to attention at this. While she didn't share much of her life, Ms. Reedy had informed Tara, on multiple occasions, that her neice lived in the midst of fashionable life in the capital.

If Tara recalled correctly, the neice had married a financier, "who play such a prominent role in the kingdom these days, you know," Ms. Reedy liked to add. Ms. Reedy doled out anecdotes about her neice strategically, as object lessons in why comportment and demenour were so important to a young woman. Even though these stories about her neice were tinged with lessons, Tara still relished these stories and sometimes found herself envious of the neice. Her life seemed so much like a real life, a life worth pursuing. Perhaps even worth the pain of adhering to Ms. Reedy's instructions to obtain.

"Yes, that's the one. Her accountn of a recent party gave me several ideas for your dress. In fact, she even included a few sketches."

Ms. Reedy passed along several folded pieces of paper. The paper was very fine and thin, and so lighly perfumed. The pages felt like artifacts that belonged to someone accustomed to very fine things indeed. The sketches themselves were servicable. Tara, even at her relatively young age, could tell that drawing had not been an accomplishment that secured the neice her current status and place.

"You see that there is very little embellishment, but very rigid lines down the mid-section."

"I like the gatherings around the skirt."

"Yes, another detail worth noting. She speaks of the bright colors that are in fashion now, as well, now that new dyes have become readily available." Tara felt deflated at this news, surely it would impossible to replicate a dress colored with dyes only available in the capital. While Tara sat with her disappointment, Ms. Reedy produced a small package at the table. "She also sent along this parcel." She pushed the box towards Tara.

"For me?"

"Yes, though it is unbecoming to second guess a gift. Good manners means accepting that such gifts and tributes are due to one in the normal course of things."

"Yes, Ms. Reedy."

"But go on and open it."

Tara did just that and discovered several glass vials swaddled in course cotton cloth. She held one up to the light, looking through a brillant solution of blue tinged with a kind of shimmering iridescence. "Beautiful," Tara whispered in awe.

"We will bring these along with us today for the dressmaker to use."

***

After lunch, Tara waited with Ms. Reedy in front of the cottage for the horse and carriage to arrive. Ms. Reedy maintained a perfectly still composure, while Tara could not help but pace around the rock strewn path that circled in front of the cottage. 

She kicked at a few rocks, furtively glancing over her shoulder to see if Ms. Reedy would catch her. Fortunately, her esteeemd caretaker and governess was absorbed in a small notebook that she kept lashed to her wrist. Finally the carriage pulled up and they were rocking and bouncing down the country road that led to the small nearby town.

The town was a small colllection of buildings and houses that clung tightly to the high road that ran through it. Tara knew from her father that there once had been a mill nearby and the high road wound its way to the capital. Most local business still routed itself along these roads and this town, what was left of it in this area.

Tara spent the hour or so ride sitting quietly looking out of the carriage window. Ms. Reedy seemed to have paused her steady stream of instructions, which left Tara free with her own thoughts. Those thoughts were mere blips of images, scenes playing out at some future point. Most of them invovled the capital and the forthcoming trip. 

She realized as they traveled that at some point she would be traveling down these roads for the last time, leaving this life behind. It wouldn't be soon, but at some point. The tree lined road that gave way to rolling farmlands, fields recently harvested. Her life had been filled with scenes like these. And then one day it wouldn't be.

At last they arrived at the dressmaker's shop. The shop sold fabrics and trimmings in bulk to the households that dotted the area. The dressmaker was playing the role of shop keep at the moment, helping a farmer's wife select several bolts of fabric that would likely make clothes for her entire family. 

When the farmer's wife finished up, they negotiated the terms of the sale, which led to some portion of the purchase being made on credit. The dressmaker then turned her attention to Tara and Ms. Reedy. 

Several hours passed before the dressmaker finished the last of the pinning and sizing. It took several tries before the fabrics she drapped over Tara resembled the sketches that Ms. Reedy produced. Tara's excitement over having a new dress made quickly faded to sulky resignation as it seemed impossible that the dress being made would live up to the ideal in her mind. 

In this situation, however, Ms. Reedy's insistence that a thing be done the right way, according to her wishes, served Tara well. Ms. Reedy continued to push the dressmaker to try again and again, until what was being fitted on Tara was right. By the end, Tara left with her excitement intact and those sketchy visions of the future in her mind being a bit more filled in with detail.

Afterwards, Ms. Reedy and Tara walked the main street looking into the small shops that survived there on a mixture of necesiity, good-will, and credit. They had stopped at a curio shop that stocked with porcelain figurines, decorative bowls, prints removed from old volumes and packed into garish frames. 

Tara had stopped in front of a shelves of figurines, some brighly painted porcelain, some cast metal, of a someone that bore a faint resemblance to someone that Tara knew very well. She wasn't allowed to have these figurines in the house. Her father found them to be garish. She picked up one with bright glassy white skin with cheeks radiated a bright red glow. Tara ran her finger along the intricate patterns on the long cloak that enveloped the figure. 

Just as she was putting the figure back on the shelf a loud clanging rang out from the village tower. Tara had heard distant echoes of the clatter from their cottage when the wind blew correctly, but never up close. She stepped out into the street with Ms. Reedy who covered her ears as politely as she could. 

Tara watched as the street cleared of traffic. Everyone walked and held themselves a little more stiffly and formally than before. The lazy, relaxed air that characterized village life seemed to change at the first strike of the gong. 

She noticed that there was a voice calling out too. She had never heard a voice before, but it called out loudly, "The vigilant approaches. Here comes the vigilant. Ready yourselves for the vigilant." And repeated this way while the alarm rang out.

Looking down the street, Tara caught the first sight of the vigilant, gliding her way down the country road. Step and after careful step, she drew closer. She moved with her usual grace, but much more quickly than Tara was used to seeing. As she drew closer, Tara could see familiar features come into focus. She could make out the swirling details of the cloak that enveloped her. 

As the vigilant swept by her, Tara would see the patterns that resolved themselves to a myriad of eyes looking out in all directions, pass by her. One of the eyes fixed on her momentarily and then looked away. But the vigilant's eye did not look her way.

"Avalon!" Tara called out, "Avalon!" But Avalon, the vigilant, passed by her with no moment of recognition at all, then disappeared in the distance towards the cottage, towards her father, towards her return, her ritual return that Tara had so anxiously awaited.

# Chapter 2 #

Once Avalon passed through the center of town and was out of sight, the townspeople seemed to resume their usual activity. Their bodies started to move they way they normally moved. Conversation that had been halted, continued on. It was if someone had put the entire town under glass like a shadowbox momentarily, then lifted the glass away. 

Tara had never experienced the effect that Avalon had on people before. Certainly she had some hint of it from Avalon's stories and from what her father had told her before about the vigilant and the vigilant's role. But witnessing herself how...changed people became surprised her. 

Seeing Avalon's cloak also surpised her. She had only seen it from afar, and had never been allowed to get very near to it. Whenever Avalon spent time with her, she never wore her "traveling clothes" as she called them. Now that she had seen the cloak in person and up close, or somewhat closer, Tara had felt the same effects as the villagers. She knew the walker in a way few other people did, but when that eye trained itself on her, her body went rigid too, afraid to move, to be recorded in the midst of some act, however unknowing and unthoughtout the act might be.

Now that life had reset to its normal pace and tone, Tara's mind leapt into action. She knew that the simply must get back home. Ms. Reedy could not resist Tara's entreaties to return home for very long. Tara refused to walk the main street anymore, stubbornly refusing to so much as budge unless it was to head towards the carriage.

At last they were on their way. Ms. Reedy could not resist instructing Tara not to fidget. Finally, Tara just sat on her hands, because she could not control her restless fingers at all. The same scenery as before passed alongside the carriage, only now it seemed to progress in a painfully slow fashion. Tara desperatly wanted to bang the side of the carriage, spook the horses somehow to speed up their pace. There was no point in going to these lengths, especially since it would likely result in a prohibition against seeing Avalon at all being imposed upon her. 

Her anticipation nearly burst forth in an exasperated cry when the carriage came to a sudden halt in the midst of their journey. The stop was so quick that Tara and Ms. Reedy both nearly bounced out of their seats.

"Why are the stopping?" Tara asked.

"I do not know. Hopefully it isn't due to brigands," Ms. Reedy replied. No matter how long she lived in this remote corner of the worlds, Ms. Reedy could not let go of the idea that run into brigands would be more likely here in the middle of nowhere than a place like the capital that Tara knew from the scandal sheets, and from Avalon herself, was rife with criminals and neerdowells.

In the event that it was brigands, Ms. Reedy kept Tara inside the carraige's cabin and forbid her from peering out the window. They could hear the driver's feet thunk on the dirt road when he jumped down. A moment passed before they heard him call out, "Ms. Reedy, you had better come take a look at this..."

Ms. Reedy fussed with her gloves for a moment before replying in a raised voice, "I will be there momentarily."

Tara could tell that Ms. Reedy did not want to answer this call for help. She fussed with gloves and sleeves, arranged her hat on her head before making for the carriage door. The driver did not sound distressed to Tara, but for all she know Ms. Reedy might think this was the exact way brigands holding someone hostage would want them to sound. Ms. Reedy opened the door slowly, peering out first. She looked back at Tara, "Stay here and do not move."

Contrary to Ms. Reedy's instructions, Tara leaned out as far as she could from the door. She saw Ms. Reedy and the driver standing in the middle of road, looking down on something. Perhaps a farmer had let produce fall from a wagon. Maybe it was a dead animal. But why wouldn't the driver just clear the obstruction himself. 

Tara could see the driver shaking his head, backing away. She could just make out him saying, "I won't and can't. Not me."

Ms. Reedy replied in a stern voice, "You must. We cannot leave her here."

"No, ma'am, I resptively decline. They say those eyes can see into your soul."

"Well at this point, your soul has been sufficiently peered into. Besides, I hope, for your sake, that there isn't any darkness lurking there."

"Well being seen is one thing, but to touch her? There's strange tales of people driven to madness doing such things."

"Don't be a fool, get on with it."

The driver edged further and further back. Tara could now see what they were standing over. She dashed out of the carriage and towards the figure. She started to fall to her knees besides Avalon, but Ms. Reedy caught her in her surprisingly strong arms. 

Tara struggled against Ms. Reedy's surprising stregth, bu could only lamely call out out, "Avalon? Avalon? What's wrong? Speak to me!" She look up at Ms. Reedy, "What's wrong with, Avalon?"

"I do not know. She must be injured."

"What are we going to do?"

Ms. Reedy let go, "Stey, do not get any closer." Tara looked down at Avalon. She was curled up with her back to them. The eyes on the cloak rolled wildly in all directions, a chaotic jumble of movement in contrast to her inert form. 

Tara had never really seen Avalon dressed in her "traveling clothes" as she had called them. She had never really been allowed to see her dressed this way. She wondered if the driver  was right. What would happen if she touched her? Did Ms. Reedy believe what the driver beleived. She must have been wary enough because they were all just standing there. Tara finally cried out, "We must do something. Please, please do something!"

Ms. Reedy, who was staring at the cloak too, seemed to snap herself out of a trance. She unclipped her traveling cloak, inched towards Avalong, and threw it over Avalon's unconscious form. She turned to the driver, "Now, will you help me?"

Tara looked at him as well, tears in her eyes, "Please I beg you."

The driver took a deep breath, as if summoning up his courage, then stepped forward wordlessly to help Ms. Reedy pick up Avalon. As they moved her towards the carriage, a trickle of blood trailed behind her.

"Ms. Reedy," Tara said, "she's bleeding. Look."

"We'll put her in the carriage. Tara and I will ride in front with you Gregory."

Gregory replied in a resigned tone, "Yes, ma'am."

***

Once they arrived Ms. Reedy instructed Gregory to inform the household of what had happened. While he disappeared in the house, Tara and Ms. Reedy coaxed Avalon out of the carriage, careful to keep her wrapped up tight. Tara's father appeared at the cottage's threshold visibly distraught. Gregory was behind him. The rest of the house staff had come to the front door as well, alerted to something happenning by the general commotion. 

Once they began to realize what was happening they shrank back inside. Tara's father stepped forward and instructed Gregory to fetch the doctor from town. Her father turned to Tara and Ms. Reedy and said, "We must take her to the tower. Follow me."

Tara was surprised by her father's instructions. She had never been allowed to see the tower, much less enter it. For as long as she remembered it was forbidden. Not even Avalon would tell her much about the structure. Tara and Ms. Reedy struggled to advance a few steps with Avalon, but struggled with the burden.

Her father who was outpacing them, stopped and turned back, "Avalon, we must get you to the tower." As if sensible to his instructions, she nodded her head weakly, then shrugged off Tara and Ms. Reedy's help and began plodding her way after Tara's father. They disappeared behind a hedgerow, leaving Tara standing in the front yard, with bloodied hands, wondering what would happen to Avalon.

Ms. Reedy guided Tara inside and tried to keep her as occupied as she could. This was difficult to do. Tara found herself overcome with restless energy. She was unable to sit for more than a few minutes at a time. She paced back and forth, interrupted only by her attempts to focus on whatever task Ms. Reedy placed in front of her.

After some time passed, Tara could hear the carriage approaching down the lane and look out of her bedroom window. She could see her father waiting outside for them. His worried looked concerned Tara even more than she already had been. Finding Avalong collapsed in the middle of the road had been alarming enough, but maybe, just maybe she was overreacting. 

In all of her pacing and worrying, she realized how little she really knew about Avalon and what her long journeys entailed. She knew that Avalon would leave for long periods of time--sometimes weeks, sometimes month. Then reappear. Her reappearance would mean that her father, usually lost in his studies and work, was even less available than usual. A day or two would pass and Avalon would reintegrate herself in to their daily lives--eatign with them, taking walks, reading in the garden. 

Then she would be gone again. Being gone usually meant more stories. So, for Tara, these absenseces were well worth the wait, especially recently, when Tara relished stories about the outside world more than ever. Avalon could have recounted every minute of every expereince she had ever had or heard about and it still wouldn't have been enough for Tara. 

Finally Gregory brought the horses to a jerking halt. The doctor alighted from the carriage and met her father who led the doctor back to the tower, where he had taken Avalon, where she could not see what was happen and could only wait until something happened that she could know about.

***

The days event wore Tara down to point that she fell asleep once she sat in bed later that evening. Everything after their return home existed only as a vague blurry memory. She hardly felt like she had been present for most of it. Not that anything of consequence had happened. In fact, the remainder of the day had been spent waiting, listening, hoping for some news about Avalon. 

No news came, only that the doctor was dispatched several hours later. Her father never returned to dinner and Tara asked Ms. Reedy meekly that broth and bread be brough to her room for dinner.

Ms. Reedy was uncharacteristically gentle and accommodating towards Tara in these hours. She quietly went down to the kitchen and returned with the requested meal. They both sat in silence until she finished. At which point, Ms. Reedy announced that she would be retiring for the night. Tara nodded and sat in her window seat until the maid came to change her into her night clothes.

She fell asleep fast but it was restless sleep. Half formed visions kept her tossing and turning. At some point a sharp cracking noise sounding in the distance startled her awake. After more tossing and turning, she couldn't fall back asleep and resolved to see what the sound might be.

As she went downstairs she could hear muted voices--a man and a woman. Her heart leapt. Maybe Avalon was better and downstairs. She turned into the kitchen only to find her father and the Bettina, the cook. Her father was sitting at rustic table that served as a work surface and dining table for the small staff that ran their house.

Her father sat there, shrinking inwards at the shoulders, hovering over a fresh cup of tea. He sipped from it and noticed Tara. She would see signs of exhaustion covered his face. Normally a thin, frail looking man, her father was, nonetheless, full of mental vitality--a vitality that animated that thin face. Now the animation was gone, replaced by fatigue, maybe even sadness.

"Tara, what are you doing downstairs?"

"I had trouble sleeping , papa, and heard noises downstairs."

"Bettina is already at her morning tasks, and offered to make me a cup of tea when she saw a light on in my study."

"Would you like one, miss?" Bettina asked from her crouching position by the fire grate.

"No, thank you Bettina. I think it would make me too nervous."

The cook kindly replied, "Bless you child, we're all worked up like sharpened knives on account of our poor Avalon."

Tara's father nodded absently and sipped at his tea. He took another sip before looking at her again. A thought seemed to pass through his mind in that moment. His face was animated again, as if waking up from a stupor. "Since you are awake, let's retire to my study. I would like to talk with you."

This announcement surprised Tara. She was rarely allowed in her father's study. And what would he would he want to talk about with her? She dutifully followed her father's slouching, sliding form through the dark halls to his study. He motioned her inside towards a chair near his desk. As she sat, he pulled the heavy pocket doors closed. 

A single candle flickered on his desk, having almost burned down to the base. He brought over two other canldes from a table near the wall of book cases and lit them both from the dying one. When he sat down at his desk, his eyes reflected the quivering candle flames, seeming like two points of light about to fade out of existence.

He gave a great sigh and just say for a moment. Tara sat silently too, clutching her knees together and her hands tightly in her lap. A chill ran over her, brough about in part by the cold still air in the study. Typically there would be a hearty fire going to keep her father warm while he worked. The hearth had been scrapped clean long enough ago what was left of the fire's heat had fled the room.

At last, her father drew himself up and began to speak. He didn't speak to her, but more around her. The effect made her feel far away from him, like an audience member of a perforamnce taking place on a stage. 

"I have learned something tonight that has caused a great disturbance," he began.

"About Avalon? And her injuries," she replied in a nearly whispering tone. "Are her injuries grave ones?"

"No, the doctor says with rest and clean dressings she will recover soon enough. We are lucky in that regard."

Tara immediately felt relieved, but her father didn't seem to be. She didn't undertand why. "If it's not her injuries, then what is bothering you papa?"

"From what I can understand of Avalon's account, she was attacked."

"Attaked? By who?"

"Again, I can't say with absolute certainty, but it sounds like Avalon was attacked by members of the King's Guard."

"Why would soldiers want to attack Avalon?"

"Tara, there is much you don't know about Avalon." Her father ran his hands through his aging, thinning hair. "Perhaps I have kept you too sheltered from the world. Well, no matter, tonight is not the night to rectify such mistakes, certainly not all at once..." He trailed off in an abstract daze of thought, until he snapped back when she replied to him.

"I am not too young to understand, papa, please tell me. Knowing halves of things is worse than knowing the whole of something, no matter how bad it might be."

"That might be, but it is late, and I want to unburden my mind before it is much later."

"Then tell me, papa, I beg you."

"Avalon plays a very special role in the kingdom, and part of my job is to see that this job is performed well. If Avalon is not able to perform her duty, then I am not able to. People like Avalon..."

"Vigilants?" Tara offered.

Her father looked puzzled by the word, "Yes, this is what they're called by many common people. Vigilants are protected by the king's order. It is a grave crime to lay hands on someone like Avalon, a vigilant. Doing so put the vigilant at risk, but so much more," her father paused here, worry creeping all over his face in the shadows. "Oh, I am having trouble even saying this directly. Avalon insists that she was attacked, but not just attacked by anyone, which would be a henious act."

"Then who attacked her father?"

"Avalon insists it was members of the King's Guard."

"But if she is under the king's protection..." Tara trailed off, still struggling to put the bits and pieces of information her father was dropping into something coherent.

"Yes, exactly, then the King has rescinded his protection, and the whole project is threatened. And because of this I have come to a difficult decision. I have... I have decided to resign from my position in protest."

"Leave your position over this? Papa, are you sure? This seems so drastic, so sudden. What will happen if you do this?"

"Tara, please, I feel with my full heart and mind that this is the right course of action. If I had someway of conveying my thoughts with more haste to the king, I would do so, especially if it relieved me of this terrible burden I feel myself carrying. Since I cannot do that, I must do the next best thing."

"What is that?"

"I must travel to the capital and tender my resignation, and my protest, before the king, in person."

"In person? To the capital? But papa, we are supposed to be traveling to the captial."

"Yes, Tara, which is why I wanted to speak to you without delay, so that you would understand the importance and urgency of our traveling to the capital as soon as we are able."

"But we are already traveling to the capital, for my..." The sad look in her father's eyes helped Tara understand the implication of his decision. "Then my trip..."

"I am sorry, Tara. I know you were looking forward to this trip. I'm afraid it will have a rather different tenor now."

"But the balls and parties?"

"We will see. I cannot predict how my news will be received. I can only hope that the King understand my concern and decision come from a place of loyalty and pride and not treason."

"Treason, papa? That is a scary word."

"Indeed." He signed heavily. "We cannot predict the future with the walls of this study. Let's return to our chambers and try to gain what little sleep we can until the sun rises."

Tara stood to leave, saying goodnight to her father as she left to return to her room where she sat stunned until fatigue compelled her to sleep.

# Chapter 3 #

Resign, resign, resign. Tara repeated the word to herself over and over. It danced through her mind for some reason. She could not chase it and capture it to rid it's snake like sounds from her memory. So the word followed her throughout the day. The word was there when her father assembled the house's small staff to make his announcement. Tara watched as looks of confusion, maybe even fear crossed the staff's faces. Only Ms. Reedy remained stoic in the face of the news.

Not long afterwards, she knocked on Tara's door and entered solemnly. Tara looked up from her book and merely said, "Ms. Reedy."

She replied with a curt "Tara."

"Is something wrong? You never gave me any lessons, so I decided to read instead." Ms. Reedy did not move and speak. So Tara added, "Ms. Reedy you are worrying me. Please say something."

Ms. Reedy started to speak in a halting way, "I have spoken with your father and have submitted by resignation to him. I will be leaving later this afternoon."

Resigned, there was that word again. Like an imp, it played and preyed on her feelings. She wished she would never hear that word again. Tara surprised herself, and certainly Ms. Reedy, by launching herself towards Ms. Reedy and embracing her in a tearful hug.

Ms. Reedy stiffened and nervously patted her head. Tara did not think she had ever hugged Ms. Reedy before. She cheek pressed against the bone stays in Ms. Reedy's dress and her arms coiled around the folds of her dress. Had she been asked, she probably could not even fully explain why she hugged Ms. Reedy, but the impulse to do it overwhelmed her.

Finally, Ms. Reedy pulled her away and rearranged her dress. She wiped a suggestion of a tear away from the corner of her eye. True to herself and her maxims, through, Ms. Reedy maintained her composure and did not let emotion rule over this moment.

"I have left instructions with the staff to help with the final preparations for your trip."

"Where will you go, Ms. Reedy?"

"I will travel north where I have a brother who is a magistrate. From there, who can say? But I feel that my time here has come to and end."

"And what about me?"

"I do not know, Tara. That is the most honest answer I can give you. I wish I knew, but now your path is unclear. You must take what I have taught you and try your best to navigate life's currents."

"I wish I understood why papa is doing this. Do you think it is right?"

"Right? That is not for me to say. Your father holds a very esteemed position in the kingdom and has served the kingdom loyally. He feels that there has been an affront to his reputation and must take this action. The decision will not be without consequence, I'm afraid. But fearing consequences shouldn't determine our sense of right and wrong."

Tara felt serious all of a sudden and considered what Ms. Reedy said. She nodded her head, "I feel that to be true."

"Then my work here is done.

###

With Ms. Reedy gone, Tara wasn't sure what she would do with her days, or what remained of her days. There was no news about Avalon and her recovery. The doctor had not visited again, leading Tara to assume that Avalon would get better sooner rather than later. Tara wanted to search her out. Avalon's room remained empty. Tara knew this after checking it several times throughout the day. She assumed that Avalon was still in the tower. Going there wasn't a possibility since the tower was off limites to her.

Tara knew that the tower was central to her father's work, but she didnt' fully understand how. After all, he spent most of his time in the study in the cottage, doing whatever he did there. But always upon Avalon's returned he would disppaer for the tower, sometimes for long stretches of time. He would be back in his office, then disappaer again. Once Avalon left again on another journey, he would settle back into his routine in the house.

She also knew that others in the household held the tower to be a place to be feared, at least avoided. Many avoided talking about it altogether. As she paced around the house, she thought more about her father's passing comment that he had kept too much from her.

As she turned over this comment in her mind, she wondered what he meant by that. She could assume it had something to do with Avalon, with his position. But beyond that she had so few bits of knowledge to cling on to to even start to speculate. She knew she lived a sheltered life and didn't understand much of the outside world. Avalon made that clear, even Ms. Reedy made that clear. But that restless desire to burst out into the world that she felt so often, as recently as the other day, suddenly changed into something more unsettling. Tara began to look at her immediate surroundings and feel that maybe things weren't as they seemed. 

To rid herself of this feeling, she decided to walk through the woods surrounding their cottage. There were numerous trails beat back by hunters and the hunted alike through the woods. One path in particular, her favorite, wound its way down to a creek that cut through the woods. She determiend that this would be her path. 

Unfortunatley, once she was in the woods, picking up the trail was harder than she had remembered. She wandered around for some time before she she could make out the path. It helped that she remembered that hunters had notched several of the trees to mark the path when they were covered with snow in the winter.

After winding along the meandering trail, she arrived at the place where the creek's rocky bed cut tthe forest in two. The water was low and the creek was little more than a trickle. She sat in the grass regardless and watched the water flowing over and around the rocks, finding the small paths to rush through on its course.

When she was a little girl, she had spent hours in the forest, by this creek, playing out elaborate stories with a cast of characters she conjured in her mind. She could only faintly recall those characters now, but she did remember the elaborate conversations she would have have out loud with them. How strange it must have seemed to overhear a little girl's half of a conversation, chattering on and one with no replies, only breaks of silence where other words should have been.

That had been before Ms. Reedy had come into the picture, befor her father started to become aware that he would need to prepare his daughter for something. She had a nurse for many years, the same nurse that had tended to her since she was an infant, when her mother, a person who she had no memory of, had died suddenly during a plague year. The nurse was growing old and wanted to live out her days with her daughters in her home village.

Her father released her from service, which percipitated something of a crisis in the household. This was the time when she had the most freedom to romp about and be a bit more wild than Ms. Reedy woudl ever had allowed. In fact, Tara could remember distinctly Ms. Reedy uttering words, "Absolutely feral," at the end of her first week with her new charge.

Ms. Reedy had not said this to Tara direclty, of course. But Tara could overhear Ms. Reedy talking loudly to her father. She knew from her experience with her previous two governesses that her father had little patience for managing these affairs. That conversation between Ms. Reedy and her father had ended with a curt, "Yes, sir" and a closing door. After that Ms. Reedy approached Tara with a iron-like resolve to mould her into something suitable beyond "life in the wilderness" as she liked to put it.

Tara didn't know if she was ready for life outside of this place or not. For so long, leaving home was something far off, something she would do as the first step in a grand adventure. And now the crisp crinkle of the leaves, the gurgle of the stream filled Tara with a longing for things to stay the same, for nothing to change. But it was going to change and she felt powerless to stop it.

###

Footsteps in the woods interrupted her reverie by the creek. She stood to leave before hearing her name whispered in the woods, a soft faint "Tara...Tara..." trickling out through the trees. She stopped and watched carefully as Avalon appeared, stepping gingerly over branches and foliage, holding her side which had been heavily bandaged.

She wore a robe, but not the robe of swirling eyes that Tara had seen her in before. Her robe was just a simple one that grazed over the ground as she walked. Avalon stopped in front of her and gave a weak smile, "I remembered that you liked this place."

Tara moved to wrap her arms around Avalon, but she stopped her with a wincing retreat. "It hurts too much, not right now." Tara stepped back, slightly embarassed. Avalon added, "Help me down, I should like to sit with you for a while. It's so peaceful here."

Sitting beside Avalon, Tara did not feel the peace herself. She was used to feeling a sense of calm around Avalon, excitement too, but a feeling that things were right and as they should be. This feeling, though, felt far away, replaced with a fidgeting discontent. Tara spoke up, "I don't feel peaceful."

Avalon gave her a sad smile and patted her bandged wounds, "Is it because of this?"

Tara considered for a moment, "I suppose so. Everything is changing. Nothing seems the same."

"The Tara that I knew would be excited by the idea. I always feared I would run out of stories to tell you to, would be unable to satiate your appetite for adventure."

"Perhaps. But nothing about this seems exciting. I don't understand why papa is resigned, leaving our home. And our trip. What's to become of me in the capital?"

"These are good questions. I wish I had answere to them."

Tara was silent and then looked at Avalon, "What exactly happened to you? Please help me understand."

"Tara, I do not claim to understand, and only have a vague recollection of what happened. Your father should know more soon. But it is an arduous process." She sighed again, then continued, "I have walked through many corners of this world, as you know. But perhaps even more than you realize. I am bound by a duty to walk to see, to witness events as they unfold in the kingdom."

Tara thought about the people in the village and their strange manner as she approached, "Is that why people reacted so strangely to you in the village?"

Avalon seemed confused by this question, perhaps not fully remembering everything that transpired the other day. "Perhaps so. It is one of the effects that my presence has on people. I am always appart when I am wearing the cloak and walking. I must be."

"In order to see?"

"In order to see clearly, to be vigilant." Tara rememebred the villagers using that word. It was one she was unfamiliar with, certainly in relation to Avalon, who was just Avalon to her.

For Tara, Avalon was this soft spoken gentle person, who told wild stories about the world. As she considered this, Tara realized that so many of Avalon's stories were about others and not herself. They were stories not about her own experiences, but things she had seen. Listening to those stories, Tara had been able to insert herself into any role she chose, much as she did when she read a story or fairy tale. But Avalon was not a part of them at all.

Avalon shook her head and looked far off, "It's all so unclear now, but I remember finding someone wounded, a boy, who was hiding in a hedgerow. He was terrified, in no small part because of my presence, I'm sure. I knew I shouldn't try to help him, but something moved me to do so. I couldn't stand to see his fear and hurt so up close, so intimately. But then we were surrounded by soldiers. Not just any soldiers, or so I recall, but members of the King's Guard. Elite soldiers. I just remembered being roughly used and then feeling a stabbing pain."

"What happened to the boy?" Tara asked.

"I do not know. I do not know who he was, or why they were after him, but they did not want me to assist him. And this is the result."

Tara took Avalon to mean her wound, but she also extended it to mean what was happeening now, to her, to her father. She could only respond with, "It doesn't seem fair."

"What doesn't?" Avalon asked.

"Any of this. It doesn't seem right or fair..." Tara trailed off.

"That what happeend in some far corner of the kingdom has set off ripples of effects that you are now feeling first hand?"

"I...I guess that is it."

"Tara, one of the blessings of your life up to now, is that you have been able to be blissfully unaware of how moments in one place affect moments in another place. We all live under the influence of forces we cannot see and sometimes cannot know. I have struggled mightly with this role, this mantle that I was tok to take up when I was not much older than you. I did not fully understand why, perhaps I don't even fully understand now. Yet I did what I was told to do, and here we are."

Tara pulled her knees in closer to the body and wrapped her arms around them. "I'm so afraid. I wish papa wasn't being so rash. Why does anyone need to know? Why couldn't he just keep this secret and not tell anyone, just let live go on the way it's supposed to?"

"I can only imagine that your father feels a responsibilty to take these actions. You must realize that he is trying to do the right thing, the best thing, in this situation. You must trust his judgment and hope for the best."

***

Later that evening, just as she was preparing for bed, Tara's father entered her room. He rarely did this, usually having some emissary to attend to her needs on his behalf. It was strange having him in her room and Tara wasn't quite sure what to do with herself. She stood awkwardly in the middle of the room waiting for him to speak. Her father stood in the room without saying anything. He looked haggard and troubled. He held a large portfolio that was bound up in cord under his arm. 

"What is that papa?" she asked him, wanting to break the silence in any way she could.

"This? My work. I finished my work and this the the full account of what Avalon saw and what happened to her."

"Do you mean what the cloak saw?"

Her shifted shifted uncomfortably, "Yes, I suppose it is. How did you know?"

"Avalon hinted at this. She didn't tell me much, but I understand a little more than I did before."

"We don't have time to go into it all now, suffice to say, that I spent many hours completing this record. It is the record that I will deliver to the king."

"Have you changed your mind about decision, papa?"

"No, if anything, this taks has strengthed my resolve. Come what may, I feel strongly that I can no longer perform my tasks in light of what happened."

Tara lowered her head, "I see."

Her father weakly countereed her disappointment with, "There is always a chance that the king will not accept my resignation. I'm one of only a few recorders left. There are not many of us. It has taken me years to develop my skills to the level they are now. I'm not easily replaceable."

"Then why do this, papa? I keep asking the question in my mind over and over again, and still do not have a good answer to it."

"Tara, to do what I do and to send Avalon out into the world to do what she does, I must know that the threat of violence or disruption doesn't hang over every moment. I strive to capture the truth of what Avalong sees in her journeys. I try to capture an accurate record. In doing so, I am protecting the past, present, and the future, providing tools so that other might understand. Now, I feel that this is under threat. Perhaps the mere suggestion of my resignation will force the king to reconsider his actions. It is worth taking this chance if this is the outcome."

He said good night and left her room. Tara tossed in bed trying to sleep. Had she known that it would be her last in this room, this bed, this home, the only one she had known, perhaps she would have slept more soundly to reslish the experience. Or perhaps she would have been spent the night completely wide-eyed, awake, trying to take in any and every sensation she could to remember later when she was very, very far away from home.

# Chapter 4 #

They set out later than her father wanted. He paced and worried over the slow progress that preparations were taking. The house staff had dwindled to just two people--Frannie, the maid, and Gregory the driver. The few others who had remained left early that morning, finishing their essential chores, and leaving notes in the kitchen announcing their intention to find work elsewhere.

Frannie helped her pack the rest of her things. Tara lamented that she did not have the dress that had been ordered from the dressmaker. She sulked over it the fact while readied herself for the journey. Ultimately, there was nothign to be done about it, so she let the sulking mood slip away and made her final perparations--packing a quarto of paper that she had sewn together herself. a drawing pad and charcoals, and several books.

When the time came to get her trunk downstairs, there was no one to help. Frannie had been called away by her father for some task or another. So, Tara did her best to drag her trunk down from her room. It bounced down the staircase and nearly exploded in the hallway. But she righted it and got it outside. Gregory stepped in and hoisted the trunk on his shoulder and attach it to the back of the carriage.

Finally, everything was packed which meant that it was time to be underway. Avalon appeared at the front of the house, standing next to Frannie, to see them off. Gregory helped Tara's father and herself into the carriage, before aligthing it himself to get them underway.

The reins popped and he muttered a quick, "Hiyah". The carraige lurched forward. Tara looked out the window and waved at Avalon, watching as the house and the two people left in it was clipped out of view by the bend in the road into the forest.

As they traveled along the rough carriage roads, Tara tried to take in as much as she could. She wanted to remember every detail of this journey. Despite the fact that the trip was now tinged with the sadness of her father's resignation, she still clung to the fact that she had never been to the capital before now. She was still as excited as the version of herself from several days ago had been about the prospect of the trip.

The road to the capital took them through the village, which had been the furthest place from her home that Tara had ever been. Once they cleared the buildings and the fields surrounding the village, she was entering country that she had never seen before.

The trip should have been a long day's journey, as her father never tired of reminding her. Afternoon rain storms conspired with their late start to slow down their progress considerably. A farmers cart had overturned on the road, which required Gregory to stop the carriage and assist them calming the horses and righting the wagon. The road was just wide enough for them to skirt around farmer adn continue on their way.

In the gray, dismal weather, Tara grew sleepy and didn't notice that it was getting dark out. She could half hear her father say, "I think we had better stop for the nigth soon." He gave instructions to Gregory to look out for a roadside establishment where they could stay for the night.

When her father nudged her awake, the rain was just a trickle rolling off the trees and buildings, but it was very dark out. She stepped out onto a wooden plank that extended through the muddy grass in front of the inn where they were taking lodging. 

Inside the inn, a fire blazed and a few laterns burned, giving out whatever light and heat they could. She kept close by her father, surprised by the glowering guests huddled at the tables around the inn's main area. She followed her father to an empty table. A boy about her age brought them water and bread, soon followed by a warm stew. 

Tara had not grown up with fancy foods, but she was used to more refined fare than what was on offer here. The bread was seedy and tart. The stew meat was tough and gamey tasting. She picked at the food at first, then finally let her hunger overcome any delicate feelings she might have been feeling.

After their meal, the same boy led them upstairs to a small, cold room with a rough hewn bed. Ropes lashed around the frames kept a lumpy mattress in place. The boy lit the stove in the corner of the room and stoked the fire to bring it to life. Once he returned with hot water for wash bowl, Tara and her father prepared for bed.

As requested, they were awoken early the next morning and found hot tea and toasted bread and butter waiting for them downstairs. Gregory joined them at the table. They all ate silently before Gregory dismissed himself to prepare the horses. Other travelers were coming and going through the inn, taking little notice of her and her father. 

It struck her that no one knew who they were here. Even though her father was not a powerful landlord or magistrate, she was used to nodding heads and small acts of deference in the people around her. Here they were yet more cold, tired travelers crossing the kingdom's lands for one purpose or another.

Their purpose that day was to arrive in the capital with as much haste as possible. The closer they got to the capital, the more worry seeemed to overtake her father. He shifted restlessly in the carriage, muttering to himself, as if rehearsing lines for a play. Tara tried to read but the bouncing carriage made her feel sick. So she leaned into the side and closed her eyes, hoping to fall asleep.

She awoke in a foggy daze to a din of people, animals, and wagons around them. She looked out the carriage windows and was ovwhelemed by the sheer number of things happened around them. A farmer was cracking a whip to lead a herd of cattle down the road. A group of soldiers were walking casually, singing loud boisterous songs. Everywhere she looked there were riders and carriages and people and they were all trained in one direction--towards the capital.

"Look, papa, there it is!" she called out, leaning dangerously out of the small window.

"Do be careful, Tara," her pleaded. He turned and looked out as well.

Directly in front of them, large stone pilings rose out of water that ran before the city, holding up a bridge that was the choke point for all of this traffic. On the other side of the river buildings scurried up the hillside in maze-like patterns, crushing up against the forbidding stone walls that surrounded the capital's inner keep. Within those stone walls, spires seemed to spring out at random until the one large structure dominated them all.

"The Grand Hall," her father said pointing to that structure. "The king's residence, the court. The heart of our kingdom," he explained.

"Will we go there?" Tara asked.

"Once we are settled, I will send a messenger to announce my arrival and my wish to see the king. Hopefully, I will be granted an audience and deliver my message. It cannot come soon enough."

Tara looked lovingly at her father and replied, "Do not worry, papa. I'm sure everything will be fine. You've always said that the king is good and noble. I'm sure he will be gracious when you pay your respects."

"Yes, I hope you are right."

***

By the time they entered the city, Tara already felt like she had had enough of it. Just crossing the bridge had taken an another hour. No matter where they turned, there were people and things clogging the roads. Tara could hear Gregory continually trying to settle the horses who were skittish in the midst of so much distraction.

They finally made their way to the section of the city where travelers would find "services to their liking", or so one passerby they asked for directions had told them. Her father pointed out a guesthouse that seemed respectable enough and went inside to reserve their room. 

With their trunks unloaded and delivered to their room, her father gave the young man helping them a small tribute in form a few coins then impressed upon him the need to find a messengar to deliver a notes to the palace gates.

Cleary confused by the request, the young man regarded him with a curious expression, "The palace gates are open most days, sir. The general public's allowed to pass to and fro, assuming they pass the guard stand, that is."

"That is very well, but I am here on a matter of some urgency and sensitivity. It is best that my arrival be known to the king by way of a courier or messenger."

Her father held out a few more coins and the young man took them readily and said, "I'll do my best, sir."

Several minutes later, the young man returned with a boy and announcing that he had returned with a messenger. Her father eyed the boy, ruddy checks, somewhat threadbare clothes, his britches spotted with dirt from another day's rain. "I was hoping for someone...a bit more official."

"I'm sorry sir, but we don't get many people of the official sort around here. When we do, we generally don't look on it too favorably, if you take my meaning. IT usually spells no good for ourselves.

"Yes, I take your meaning, young man. Can he be trusted?" The man and the boy stayed silent momentarily, "Well, boy what say you?"

"Me, sir? I run all sorts of errands around these parts. I bring around bread and beer to the workmen. I fetch horses, all sorts of things."

"I have here an important letter that I need delivered with haste. Can you do it?"

"I think I can and jump right into it too."

"Very well then." Her father produced a letter from the folio case he carried with him and had sat on the bed. "This is the letter. And here is a downpayment for you troubles."

The boy wasn't used to having metal dropped in his hands like the young man was. His eyes lit and he dashed out of the room. They could hear him clomping down the stairs and out into the street.

The young man bowed and took his leave, leaving Tara and her father alone in the small room. Her father turned to her and said, "And now we wait."

***

Several hours passed before a knock finally came at the door. Tara and her father had both dozed off, partly due to the fatigue from traveling, but also from the intense late afternoon sun that warmed up their room.

The knock starteled Tara awake. She looked over to find her father more asleep than she. She sat up and rocked him genty, "Papa, someone is at the door."

"Huh? The door? Yes, right away." The knocking continued. It was a quiet but steadfast knocking. Her father sat up as well and rubbed his hands quickly over his face to invigorate himself. He spoke up more loudly, "Coming, coming..."

As he walked to the door he rearranged his shirt, smoothed his breeches and coat out. Tara realized that he was trying to make himself presentable, though she wondered why. Would the kind be appearing here in their room? She stood too, just in case that happened to be how things unfolded.

When her father opened the door and saw the same young man as before standing here, they both seemed to deflate a little. Certainly her father's sigh spoke to a sense of disappointment. "Do you have any word from the palace?" her father asked. 

"No sir, not exatly." Her father stepped back and sighed. He was so eager to execute this task that every little delay seemed to be waring on him. Her father started to close the door but the man spoke up, "There's more. There is someone here to see you." 

"From the palace?"

"I can't rightly say. Older gentleman. Somewhat plainly dressed."

"You may send him up, then."

"That's just it, sir. He insisted that you come down."

"I see." Her father seemed to be thinking through what this might mean. "Is there a private room we might use to confer with this visitor for a short time?"

"Private room? Not exactly, not for guests. I suppose you could make use of the back parlor that the family that runs the inn maintains for itself. I would need to ask permission of course."

"Please do, then we will be right down."

"Yes, sir." The young man disappeared to inquire about the room then reappeared, "I'll show you the way."

He led them down a back stair case that as hidden behind a paneled door, "Pardon the servant's stairs, but it's the most convenient." Her father didn't say anything, so Tara interjected a quiet, "Not at all" to be polite.

They entered a small room with a fireplace, dark wood paneling, and dark, overstuffed furniture. Standing with his back to the room, looking out the window, was a tall man dressed in a long dark coat and dark trousers. He turned to reveal an old gaunt face decorated with a thick gray beard. Yet in spite of the profusion of gray hair and wrinkled skin, the man exuded a sense of power from this broad shoulders and glinting eyes. 

Those same eyes sized them both up, her in particular. She could feel his gaze linger on her, as if cataloging all of her traits and qualities for some future purpose. She felt evaluated, summed up in this simple action.

"Please sit," the man said to them. "You may leave us," he instructed the young man. All parties obeyed him without hesitation. He sat in one of the arm chairs opposite them, but perched on the very edge of the cushion. "So, I am to understand that you wish an audience with the king?"

"Yes, that is correct. I have urgent business with him."

"Mmmm, of course. Do you have your credentials?"

Now it was her father's turn to straighten himself up, "Credentials? I said who I saw in my note and stated my intention clearly enough. That has always sufficed in the past."

"Perhaps, but I am responsibble for the ways of today, not of the past. Besides if you are who you are, it has been, what? Some fifteen years since you have paid his majesty a visit. And I am to assume from some street urchin's note announcing the presence of one of the king's recorders in the capital, that said recorder has decided to make his presence known."

Tara couldn't help but interject into the conversation on behalf of her father, "My father has served the king loyally and well for as long as I can remember?"

The old man looked at her with a flat deadpan expression, "And how far back does your memory go, young lady?"

Her father stood, "This is an outrage. I'm being treated like a common subject. My position used to be held with revernce and esteem, particuarly by functionaries of the court."

The man smiled, "No doubt. But this functionary stand between you and your request to access the court. And this functionary has been asked to review your credentials, per the king's orders."

The moment of defiance was over as the color drained from her father's face. He sat back down and produced a small quarto sheet of paper that had been neatly folded and still bore a wax seal on it. The man stood to collect them and moved to the window to inspect them in the full light of the window.

He turned back to them and said, "I will be keeping these for further review. I suggest that you not venture far from this inn, as you will be under surveillance until your credentials can be properly verified." With that he collected a tall dark hat to round out his costume, tipped it to them both, bid them good day, and left them alone in the room to reflect further on what had just happened.

Her father paced their room, fuming, in his quiet nervous way about the treatment he had just received. "This is outrageous," he cried out. "Unheard of. I have loyally served the king and the king's father before him. The king should know not to trifle with someone in my position. I know many things, many secrets. A person in my position should be held in esteemed, not degraded like this." 

Tara had never seen her father fume like his, never seen him talk about his status and position in such a a away as to elevate himself above others. Yet here he was in this small room in an inn somehwere in the capital city asseting that he was important and needed to be heard and taken seriously.

Her father paused, "Do you think the King knows why I am here?"

Tara finally ventured a quiet reply, not wanting to inflame her father's nervous agitation any more than was necessary, "I cannot say."

"That man, that foul functionary spoke of spies." Her father looked around, though at what Tara could not say exactly, "Perhaps there are spies everywhere. Do you think there were spies in our household?"

"Papa, who would have been a spy?"

"Maybe..." her father rubbed his chin vigoursly, making a rasping sound as he fingers grazed the day old stubble on his cheeks, "Maybe Ms. Reedy. She disappeared suddenly once she learned the news."

"Papa, please listen to yourself. Ms. Reedy? She was with us for years."

"Waiting, as spies do. I must get to the bottom of this. This is simply unfathomable, unbelievable."

Tara finally stood up and rested her hands on her father's shoulders. They were normally curved in slightly, presumably from the time he spent hunched over his work, but there were even more bowed in on themselves now. When she touched him, the coil of energy that was propelling him around the room unwound. He nearly went limp. 

She steered him towards the bed and suggested he rest. "Would you like a cup of tea, father?" He nodded yes and closed his eyes, sighing as he did so.

Tara rang a small bell and a young woman appeared this time at their door. She was about the same age as the young man. They resembled each other so much that Tara assumed they were brother and sister.

"Yes?" the young woman asked in a tone that was neighter friendly or unfriendly, helpful or unhelpful. She didn't seem particlarly harried, but didn't seem to relish her job either.

"My father needs rest, and a cup of tea to calm him. Would you send one up?"

"Yes, is that all?" 

The woman turned to leave, "And one more thing, is there a market nearby? I would like to purchase from fresh fruit for him as well."

There is, in the square a few blocks from here. There won't be much left at this time of day, but that's for you the decide if it's worth your time and all."

"Thank you," Tara replied and timidly reached out to give the young woman a coin in payment. 

The young woman turned it over in her hand and frowned, slipped it into her apron and disappeared downstairs. 

When her father was situated with tea and a small cake, Tara put on her traveleing cloak with it deep dark hood and set out to find the market.

She wandered into the street, not aware of the carts and people swirling around her and heading towards her. Several passerbys shouted out curses to her to move. Tara reeled at first, then got her bearings, and proceeded to find the market. She immeditaly saw that someone was following her from the other side of the street, but decided to ignore this for now. After all, the man had warned them that her and her father would be followed.

She finally found her way to the market, rows of shabby tents that huddled in the middle of a clearing. Around the edge of the clearing, buildings teetered on each other, some reaching up several stories. Being in the market gave Tara the sensation of having been swallowed by a gaping mouth. The buildings seeemd to loom and threatened to close her up.

A mixture of organic smells pervaded the market, from the produce that was ripeneing in the afternoon sun, animals that were waiting to be purchased. She stepped over tricles of blood from meat that had been freshly slaughtered. And the people. She bumped into and bounced off of the people who were jostling in the market to make their purchases.

Tara walked the aisles of the market several times before finding a merchant with fruit that seemed to be of the quality she was used to. An old woman sat on a crate and eyed her suspiciously while she picked through the apples. Finally the woman snapped, "One's as good another. Make a decision."

Instictively Tara replied, "Yes, ma'am. I didn't mean any offense."

The woman sneered at her, not caring to hear Tara's apologies and polite words. "Do you have coin for the purchase?"

Tara fetched the money from small pouch tied around her wrist that she kept hidden in the sleeve of her dress. She handed over the money then indicated that she wanted a bunch of grapes. She paid for those as well and started to make her way out of the square.

A crowd had gathered at the far end of the market. Tara's wanderings led her to the crowd and she found herself attached to it. Puppeteers had set up and improvised puppet theater and were entertaining the children and adults alike.

Tara decided to stay and watch the show. The cast included a puppet dressed as a king, a knightly soldier, and a peasant farmer. In most of the stories, the king and knight were plotting to one up the peasant--steal his cow, take his land, or trick him into fulfilling some dangerous task. The peasant farmer had the knack of getting out of any scrape and making the king and knight look foolish in the process. 

Much like the audience, Tara found herself smiling and laughing at the foolish exploits of the characters. She glanced over at one point and noticed the man who had been following her, leaning up against a building wall, looking stoic and unamused by the show.

She decided it was best to move on and return to the inn. She was anxious to get the fruit back to her father, hoping it would refresh and revive him. As she turned to leave, she caught a peculiar sight out of the corner of her eye. A figure had its back to her, then turned in profile, at one of the market stalls. The figure held up a basket that received whatever purchase was being made. The figure then turned to leave. Tara insitinctively stepped foward, saying out loud, "Ms. Reedy?"
