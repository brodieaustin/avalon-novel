# Ch 1: More Than This #

"Where is Avalon? I want to see Avalon!" the princess shouted, running in her morning dress to her bedroom door. She slammed herself against it, surprised for a moment by how sturdy and unforgiving it was, unbending even to the wishes of its princess.

"Princess, please. Please I beg you..."

The princess turned, leaving the little hurt caused by the door behind. She pivoted into her frustration and anger, turning to the chambermaid. She raised a delicate arm with its pointed finger straight at the unassuming young woman, "You! You're the cause of this."

The chambermaid, clutching the princess' daytime undergarments, trying desperately to get her dressed so she could move on to her other morning chores, took a step back, took several in fact, catching her foot on the base of the clawed dressing table. "No, I promise you. This isn't me. I delivered the house mistress your request. I swear."

Now circling around a worn spot in the layered carpets in her chambers, the princess fumed, "No you didn't. You're a sneaking and conniving thing." She paused, "And you're not good at your job. I know. I saw when you attended Avalon. I saw your little mistakes then, and I see them now. There's nothing left to do but..." The princess made for a lattice-work grill at the end of a pipe extending from the wall.

The chambermaid dashed towards the princess, seized her arm without realizing what she was doing, "Please no..."

The princess tore away from the chambermaid's grasp. "How dare you! You could be executed for doing that!"

The chambermaid went rigid, straightened herself up, but bowed her head low. "Please forgive me, princess. It's just that..."

"Just what?" The chambermaid was silent. "Go on. Explain yourself."

"If I'm reassigned one more time, I may be expelled from the house. And then my mother. My poor dear mother. What will we do?"

The chambermaid was on the verge of crying. The princess could see that, could see the young woman's shoulders quivering under her dark servant's dress. The princess turned away from her maid, folded her arms tightly across her body. She closed her eyes and took a breath. Just as Avalon had taught her. Avalon was the only person who could lift her from these angers she had, the sads, and other unwanted feelings.

She wanted to see Avalon, because then everything would feel right and better. She would be who she really was and who she really wanted to be, the beloved princess, the treasure, the token. But she couldn't see Avalon and now she made her maid cry. What would Avalon say?

The princess turned back to the maid. "Fine. Say you're sorry and I will forget your indiscretion. "

The chambermaid curtsied and said in a hushed voice, "I'm truly sorry princess. You are merciful and..."

"You don't need to make a show out of it. Stop that and get me dressed."

"Yes your highness."

"And I want to know the moment that Avalon is available to be seen. Do you understand?"

"Of course. As soon as we're done I will tell the house mistress."

"Good, then we have an understanding. Please proceed with my morning."

As the maid dressed her, the princess wished she had not scolded her the way she had. Normally her new maid was efficient, but chatty at same time. The princess enjoyed hearing about the gossip among the servants, even if she pretended otherwise.

Now the maid's efficiency felt forced, and her silence deliberate. But the princess let her finish her morning preparations and curstsey her way out of the princess's room.

As she normally did, the princess remained at her dressing table brushing out her long dark hair, until she was called down for breakfast. Normally one of the second or third tier maids would lightly knock on her door and whisper, "My lord and lady are ready for you, your highness."

The princess nearly dropped her brush when, instead of a light tap, there was a sharp rap on the door and it opened. The house mistress came into her room. She stopped, though, once inside the room, as was the custom and waited for the princess to acknowledge her.

The princess brushed her hair several more times, before turning in her chair to acknowledge that the house mistress, one of her mother's favorite servants, had entered her chambers.

The house mistress tilted her neck just enough to avoid breaching protocol, but didn't hide the brusque tension in the gesture.

Finally impatient with the little game they were playing, the princess said curtly, "Yes, what is it? Breakfast time again?"

"Yes your highness, but not just that. Your maid told me..."

"I knew she would go squealing to you..."

"I assure you there was no squealing involved. I simply wanted to inform you that I received your message about Avalon."

"Fine, then I expect to see her as soon as it is possible."

"Convenient, your highness."

"Convenient? Convenient for who?"

"Convenient for the priests and for Avalon."

"Priests!? What do they have to do with anything? I only ask for patience."

"Princess, as you well know, they have to do with many things."

The princess scrutinized the house mistress closely, looking her up and down. The woman seemed more imperious than usual. What was the reason?

The princess stood and swept her way in her fine dress to the windows overlooking a cultivated garden outside the great house where she lived. "I don't understand all of this talk about convenience and patience."

She could hear the wizened woman let out a barely detected sigh, "Yes, your highness, but I have orders that you are not to disturb Avalon until it is convenient, for her, as well as the priests."

"And these orders came from?"

"From my lady, your highness."

The princess fumed, tightening her fingers into white knuckled knots, "Well that figures. There is only one solution for this, and that solution lies beyond one. I will take my leave for breakfast now."

"As you wish, your highness." The house mistress retreated from her room, leaving the princess alone in her room with her anger and frustration.

She stood at the window for several minutes, watching the gardeners pushing carts along the grounds, trimming hedges, picking weeds, and doing the hundreds of tasks that the King's, her father's house required, to maintain its stature as the finest and grandest house in the land.

***

Her mother and father sat at a long table in the great hall eating breakfast. Servants stood stiffly in the wings, waiting to attend to the King and Queen's needs.

Her father looked up and nodded at her in acknowledgement then returned to reading from a despatch box of papers spread out around him. Her mother wiped her mouth carefully and motioned her to an empty seat.

"Sit darling and eat your breakfast."

She plodded into the room and plopped into the chair, wanting her dissatisfaction to register plainly. But the plodding and plopping barely registered with her father.

Her mother arched and eyebrow and gave her father a meaningful look, but the King ignored her, preferring to grunt over whatever it was he reading at the moment.

The princess ignored her mother's meaningful look and made room for the servants to place her breakfast before her. She knew that if she could engage her father, she could get the barriers keeping her from visiting Avalon to go away.

"Father, must you read at the table."

"Your father is busy right now and those papers must be returned. Now dear, let's talk about our day."

"Our day? What day?"

"Why this day, of course. Today. Why, what other day would I be referring to?"

"How am I to know? Why does today deserve a day? That's my question."

Her father peered up from his papers and said gruffly, "The priests are due to arrive today, you know that," and went back to her reading.

The princess could see a look of exasperation pass across her mother's face, as if some agreed upon stratagem between her mother and father had broken down. If her mother had been the type, she imagined that she would have kicked the King under the table.

Instead, she composed her self, took another sip of coffee. When her cup clinked back down, she looked at the princess again, as if ready for another volley, "Yes, as your father said, the priests are due to arrive. And, darling, it causes such a disturbance. I thought it would be pleasant to plan an outing. I already have the warden making preparations. I thought we could observe the deer in the eastern forest. The warden told me that there a new season of fawns have been born. What do you say?"

The princess eyed her parents and decided to charge ahead, full frontal, with her demand, rather than retreat behind the pleasant plans that her mother was trying to distract her with. "I want to see Avalon. She's been gone for weeks now and I want to see her."

"Out of the question," her father replied, in the voice he reserved for ministers and commanders, and sometimes his daughter.

"But father..."

"Dear, what your father means..."

Her father, the King, put down his papers and replied, "What your father means is no. You are forbidden to see Avalon until you are told otherwise. Do you understand?" The princess slumped in her chair. "Do you understand?"

"Yes, father."

Her father's eyes brightened and he smiled at her mother, he bushy mustache crinkling around his mouth, "Good, then we have an understanding. No more talk of Avalon until otherwise noted."

Her mother, following her father's example, smiled as well. "Good. Then about that outing..."

***

The east woods were at the very edge of the King's personal estate. Surely her mother had chosen that location on purpose. They would spend most of the day just traveling there and back.

The princess was not in the mood to ride horses, much to her mother's disappointment. Her mother had met her out near the stables in her riding attire, seemingly bounding with energy. The princess had changed into traveling attire, but nothing that was appropriate to wear riding.

Besides, even if she had been in the mood to ride, which truthfully she probably was, she wasn't going to satisfy her mother's sense of mission and duty to distract her today, but saddling up her favorite horse. She gave the chestnut horse a few gentle pats on his nose, before meeting her mother at the carriage.

They sat out, a train of two carriages, on the rough roads to the east woods. Her mother's companion rode with them in one carriage. Two servants rode with their provisions in another. A forestman and the warden rode alongside the train on horseback.

As they rocked and rattled over the roads, her mother chatted freely with her companion about all manner of things going on in the kingdom and the household. From time to time, her mother would lean across and pat the princess's arm, "Darling, cover your ears for this part," whenever the talk turned to some item of personal business that her mother deemed unsuitable for her.

The princess would half-heartedly comply, but really her mind was far away. In fact, her mind was wandering through the stories that Avalon often told her when she visited her. She found herself in other lands, some arid and dry, others nothing more than small islands dotting an exanse of water.

She could imagine the warriors that fought long dangerous battles in Avalon's stories. She could hear the whispers and intrigue inside the royal courts that always seemed more exciting and glamorous than the court she lived in.

When Avalon told her stories, new worlds opened up to the princess, worlds she could hardly fathom, and assumed she would never see in person, at least not until the distant future when young father and mother had passed on their titles became hers.

Assuming they did. Assuming she wanted them. That's what being with Avalon impressed upon her the most. There was more in the world than the household she lived in and all of the constraints that came along with that. She couldn't imagine giving up being a royal, of course, perhaps the most important royal family of them all. Her father was the Divine King, after all.

But even now as she rocked along on some winding but unbending route to the eastern woods, she couldn't help but let her imagination wander among those lands, those places, those people that seemed much more than this, whatever this was at the moment.

***

"Why don't you go exploring?" her mother said to her, as if she was still a little girl in plaited braids, full of dimples and cute sayings. Her mother was busy overseeing the servants setting up for lunch. The forestman and warden were busy trundling the heavy lunch table from spot to spot, trying to follow her mother's wayward gestures.

The princess sighed and decided to set off into the woods after all. She followed the trickling sound of the creek that flowed through the woods, half remembering that a rustic wooden bridge crossed the creek at some point.

The flood and flow of instructions from the picnic spot stared to give way to rustle of creatures in the forest bed, to bids chirping in the tress above.

"You actually like the woods," she said out loud to herself, a habit she associated with her younger self. She had put that habit away recently now that she was properly older and talking to yourself was not proper.

She replied silently: Yes but that was before and this is now.

Regardless, she felt a flutter of excitement upon seeing the bridge, remembering when crossing that bridge meant crossing to a new world, a new land. Maybe one of the land's from Avalon's stories. There had been a period of time when Avalon's stories did come to life around her in places like that, places that seemed different from some other place.

She stopped in the middle of the bridge, crouching down to watch the rippling current pass under her. Small fish darted along the sandy bottom that glistened in the sunlight. She saw a turtle making its way across the creek, opposite of the direction she was heading in.

Pausing, she studied its slow, persistent motions, watched it kick and glide its way across the creek's current. It didn't move with great urgency, but it made its way.

Once the turtle disappeared in the brush lining the creek, the princess continued across to the other side. When her feet touched the ground again, she suddenly remembered a grove of old trees where she would spent hours as a little girl. She wondered if she could remember where it was.

Up to this point, she had been following a very rough narrow trail, probably made by the woodsman or maybe people long before them who had wandered these woods. She knew from Avalon that these woods weren't always part of the estate. But those times seemed as far removed as the far away worlds in Avalon's stories.

The grove she remembered wasn't on the trail. She thought she needed to strike off to the left at some point. As she walked, she remembered a series of mossy boulders that had been the marker for her to turn. There were the rocks just up ahead.

Even now she could picture herself walking into deepest parts of the forest, the tree cover getting thicker, the world feeling very far away. But something was different. The way up ahead seemed much lighter than before. Up ahead and to the right, she realized that a road had been cut into the woods.

When she reached the road, she stopped and stared down the ragged, turning path it made. She couldn't tell exactly where it went. But it cut in the opposite direction too, towards the grove. She turned and followed the road.

The road was littered with splinted and split wood. Much of it was still relatively bright and fresh looking. "This road is still new," she said out loud.

As she reached the road's terminal point, she gasped. She gasped because she was walking into a clearing, a clearing that she had never seen before now. This clearing wasn't a pleasant meadow full of weedy grasses and grazing animals. It was barren and stumpy, littered with the remnants of the trees that had been chopped down and taken away.

"They've cut down the trees!" she cried out, out loud again. She replied in her mind: Of course they did. Where do you think they get wood for furniture and other things in the world?

She knew the counterpoint she raised was a reasonable one, but the realization hurt nonetheless. Seeing these razed trees just added to the corded up frustration she was already carrying today. She dropped to her knees and started to sob, letting the angry, frustrated tears flow freely.

***

She cried herself dry, and just knelt in the clearing, holding her face in her hands until a voice sounded out, "Why are you crying? Are you okay?"

She stood up and circled around, scanning the clearing of the voice that called out to her. She didn't see anyone and wondered if in her her current state she was hearing things.

Then she heard a branch break and a figure stepped into the clearer. The figure was really nothing more than a child, a boy, younger than her by several years, wearing a thin robe. His head was shaved, but already covered in a scruffy stubble, and he held onto to a coarse sack slung over his shoulder.

"Are you sure you're okay? I heard you crying."

The princess wiped at her eyes and nose, self-conscious of the color that had probably spread over her cheeks. She could almost hear her mother saying, "That's an ugly look you've got. Cheer up, darling." "I'm fine. And even if I wasn't it isn't any of your business."

The boy looked at her, turned his head and shrugged. "Okay, it sounded like you were pretty upset. I thought an animal was caught in a trap. I heard you crying from far away."

"I said I'm fine. "Why are you here?"

The boy scratched his head and then looked up at the sky, "Well that's a big a question. I don't know that I have time to answer that. Let me see..."

She cut him off, "I would like to know who are. You're trespassing in the King's lands."

"I am?" The boy looked around puzzled. "That's great!" In his enthusiasm he started off across the clearing, marching right past her.

"Wait! Stop! Where are you going?"

"I'm crossing the clearing. I got lost and wandered around for a long time, just hoping that I would end up where I was told to go. I really hope I'm not late."

"Late for what?" she asked, but the boy had already disappeared into the wood. She took off after her, leaving behind the spectacle of her sadness and grief among the stubble and stumps in the clearing.

She had to keep a quick pace to keep up with him. "Stop, please, stop."

The boy stopped in his tracks and turned to her, finally allowing her to ask again, "Where are you going?

"Well, I'm really not supposed to say."

"So it's a secret."

"Kind of, yes. I would say it's a secret."

"What if I command you to tell me?"

The boy erupted in a laugh that doubled him over, "Command me? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. You can't command someone to tell a secret." Then the boy became reflective and stared at her intensely, "Can you?"

"Well I am a princess, so I believe that I can, yes."

"You're a princess? I've never met a real princess before." He started circling around her.

"There aren't any princesses where you're from, wherever you're from?"

"No, not that I'm aware. No princesses. There's are other people that give orders and tell others what to do, but no princesses."

"So I take it you're not one of these, how did you put it, 'people who tell other people what to do'?"

"Not really. Well, maybe... Not yet."

"What kind of answer is that? I'm completely confused by you. You are the most confusing boy I've ever met."

"I apologize. You're not the first person to say that to me."

Now that he was closer to her, the princess how tightly his skin stretched over his round face. The sun had turned his skin darker than hers. His finger nails were unkempt and dirty. He had a look of being generally disorderly and not well cared for.

And yet here he was wandering the world, wandering into her world, on the King's lands with some kind of secret purpose that he refused to share with her.

The boy's stomach grumbled, "I need to keep walking, I don't want to be late."

They started walking again, though the boy's pace was slower than before, "Are you hungry? Thirsty?" she asked him.

"I'm starving but I don't have time to waste. I made a promise and I have to keep that promise."

"But surely that promise should allow for tending to your basic needs. It doesn't sound like a very good promise that won't allow you to eat or sleep or other things to keep living. How will you fulfill your promise if you can't survive?"

"That's a good point. I really am hungry. Do you have anything to eat?"

"I don't..." the boy's face sank in disappointment, "But I know where to get food."

"Is it far away?"

"No it's very close."

"How close?"

"Just down this path. There is a another clearing, a proper clearing, along the creek."

"And there is food there? What kind of place is this? Is this a magical forest?"

"No silly, it's the King's Forest. The Eastern Forest to be exact. It's not magical, not in that way."

"Then why is there food just laying around in the woods? It's not just a bunch of mushrooms is it? I can't stand mushrooms. That's all I've eaten for days. That and a few birds eggs."

The princess tried to imagine this boy climbing up a tree to steal bird eggs. It was surprisingly easy to image this happening. "My mother is there, setting up a picnic. We brought too much food for just the two of it. You're welcome to some if it, if you'd like it."

"I would love that. Let's walk faster. Faster walking, sooner eating. That's my motto."

The princess assumed that it wasn't, in fact, his motto, but she smiled at the spirit anyway, and picked up her pace to try to stay abreast with the little boy who was barreling down the wooded path.

***

They startled her mother as they came crashing through the woods and entered the picnic spot. Her mother gasped, one of the servants nearly dropped a tray. The princess scanned the spot, only her mother, her mother's companion and the servant remained. The forestman and the warden were no longer part of the party.

"Darling, where have you been, and who in the world do you have with you?"

"I was wandering in the woods, just as you told me do." She decided not to share with her mother the news about the clearing at this time. "And this... This is..."

"Oh, my name is Leif," the boy said.

The princess nudged him and whispered, "Your majesty."

"But I'm not a majesty," the boy replied at full volume, clearly confused by what she meant.

"No, her, my mother. She's the queen. Say you're majesty and bow."

The boy's eyes were even wider than when he had learned she was a princess, "You're a queen. Pleased to meet you you're majesty. I've never met a real life Queen before."

"That's quite alright and to be expected," her mother replied. The princess was already annoyed at the tone that her mother was taking.

"Leif has been traveling and is hungry. I invited him to picnic with us."

"With us? Why I don't know dear."

The princess rushed forward she sat on knees before her mother, in a pose of daughterly pleading. "Please mother, he seems very good natured and so very hungry. Think of the good it will do."

It wasn't clear, even to her, what kind of good feeding the boy would do exactly, but she could see that her appeal to doing good in the world struck a chord with her mother. In a hushed tone her mother replied, "That is fine dear. We will make a place for him to eat, but over there."

"No! Mother! He must eat with us."

"I was hoping for a pleasant picnic with my daughter..."

"Mother..."

"Fine. Very well, I am much much too pliable a parent. Wouldn't you agree?" she asked her lady's companion, who nodded and replied with a terse, "Yes, my lady. But in bending, you model the true meaning of grace for your daughter."

"I had not considered it in that light." her mother replied. The princess know that her mother always looked positively on opportunities to school her in the correct courtly manner. Her mother's upbringing, by her own telling, had been marked by many such lessons and had led to her consider rise in station and status. Presumably she carried the same expectations for her daughter, to marry well and advance the family's name.

Her mother looked over her should at the boy and said, "Young man, my daughter says that you are hungry, please come join us for our picnic."

"I would love to!" the boy dashed forward, stopped himself, bowed in a halting way, and added, "Your majesty."

***

The boy was either masterfully evasive or much too hungry to answer questions in a clear manner. As they ate on the spread out linens covering the grass by the creek, they chattered and discussed and gossiped, but he remained very quiet. Not exactly quiet, the princess observed. He made a terrible ruckus and mess when he ate, in part because every bit he took had an attending commentary.

After several attempts to draw him out and reveal more details about himself, her mother finally gave up and turned her attention to her companion. The princess scooted herself closer to the boy so they could talk more privately without the adults overhearing what they were saying.

"Do you want to know why I was crying?" she asked him.

He took another bite of the cold roast quail and nodded his head, "Of course. I wouldn't have asked," he said through his bites of food.

"It was the trees."

"The trees?" he seemed puzzled. "I didn't see any trees."

"That's my point. That's why I was crying. That used to be a grove of very special trees, at least to me when I was younger. Now they're gone."

The boy had stopped eating, "What happened to them?"

"Cut down, I assume. Didn't you see the tree stumps and broken branches everywhere?"

"I was too distracted by your crying"

"That's not a nice thing to say."

"I didn't mean anything by it."

She settled the play of anger that crossed into her voice, "It's fine. I didn't know that the trees had been cut down. I was surprised, and I...I don't know, I just started to cry."

"Do you feel better?"

"I guess. I don't know. I would feel better if the trees had not been cut down."

The boy stared off past her at the creek as it bubbled along past them.

"What are you look at?"

"The creek. The water. Do you ever wonder if the water knows where it is going?"

The princess turned to watch the water. "I've never really considered it."

"It's carried along by something it doesn't really understand, but it keeps flowing, keeps being water either way."

The princess looked at him, not quite sure what the say. Where had this observation come from? He seemed so careless, even carefree about the world around him. She had spent countless hours watching these waters pass her by and had never thought anything like that before. He was the strangest little boy she had ever met.
