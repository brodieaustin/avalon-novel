# Ch 1: More Than This #

"Where is Avalon? I want to see Avalon!" the princess shouted, running in her morning dress to her bedroom door. She slammed herself against it, surprised for a moment by how sturdy and unforgiving it was, unbending even to the wishes of its princess.

"Princess, please. Please I beg you..."

The princess turned, leaving the little hurt caused by the door behind. She pivoted into her frustration and anger, turning to the chambermaid. She raised a delicate arm with its pointed finger straight at the unassuming young woman, "You! You're the cause of this."

The chambermaid, clutching the princess' daytime undergarments, trying desperately to get her dressed so she could move on to her other morning chores, took a step back, took several in fact, catching her foot on the base of the clawed dressing table. "No, I promise you. This isn't me. I delivered the house mistress your request. I swear."

Now circling around a worn spot in the layered carpets in her chambers, the princess fumed, "No you didn't. You're a sneaking and conniving thing." She paused, "And you're not good at your job. I know. I saw when you attended Avalon. I saw your little mistakes then, and I see them now. There's nothing left to do but..." The princess made for a lattice-work grill at the end of a pipe extending from the stone wall.

The chambermaid dashed towards the princess, seized her arm without realizing what she was doing, "Please no..."

The princess tore away from the chambermaid's grasp. "How dare you! You could be executed for doing that!"

The chambermaid went rigid, straightened herself up, but bowed her head low. "Please forgive me, princess. It's just that..."

"Just what?" The chambermaid was silent. "Go on. Explain yourself."

"If I'm reassigned one more time, I may be expelled from the house. And then my mother. My poor dear mother. What will we do?"

The chambermaid was on the verge of crying. The princess could see that, could see the young woman's shoulders quivering under her dark servant's dress. The princess turned away from her maid, folded her arms tightly across her body. She closed her eyes and took a breath. Just as Avalon had taught her. Avalon was the only person who could lift her from these angers she had, the sads, and other unwanted feelings.

She wanted to see Avalon, because then everything would feel right and better. She would be who she really was and who she really wanted to be, the beloved princess, the treasure, the token. But she couldn't see Avalon and now she made her maid cry. What would Avalon say?

The princess turned back to the maid. "Fine. Say you're sorry and I will forget your indiscretion. "

The chambermaid curtsied and said in a hushed voice, "I'm truly sorry princess. You are merciful and..."

"You don't need to make a show out of it. Stop that and get me dressed."

"Yes your highness."

"And I want to know the moment that Avalon is available to be seen. Do you understand?"

"Of course. As soon as we're done I will tell the house mistress."

"Good, then we have an understanding. Please proceed with my morning."
